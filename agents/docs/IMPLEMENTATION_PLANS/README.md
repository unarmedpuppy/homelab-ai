# Implementation Plans Directory

**Status**: Future Work Plans  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-13

## Purpose

This directory contains detailed implementation plans for future agent system enhancements. These are **future work plans**, not active implementation.

## Plans Overview

### Master Plan
- **`00_MASTER_PLAN.md`** - Master plan organizing all recommendations

### Individual Component Plans
- **`01_ORCHESTRATION_LAYER.md`** - Orchestration layer (NOW + LATER)
- **`02_LEARNING_AGENT.md`** - Learning agent implementation
- **`03_CRITIQUING_AGENT.md`** - Critiquing agent implementation
- **`04_EVALUATION_FRAMEWORK.md`** - Evaluation framework
- **`05_AGENT_GYM.md`** - Agent Gym (process simulation)
- **`06_TRANSPARENCY_GUARDRAILS.md`** - Transparency and guardrails

### Architecture
- **`ARCHITECTURE_REALITY_CHECK.md`** - Architecture reality check (NOW vs. LATER)

## Status

**⚠️ These are future work plans, not active implementation.**

These plans were created based on the Agent Architecture Audit and are organized into:
- **NOW**: Components that work with current Cursor session-based architecture
- **LATER**: Components that require process-based architecture

## When to Reference

- When planning future enhancements
- When evaluating architecture changes
- When implementing new agent capabilities
- When understanding system evolution

## Current System

For current system documentation, see:
- **`agents/docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`** - Current system architecture
- **`agents/docs/AGENT_WORKFLOW.md`** - Current workflows
- **`agents/README.md`** - Main entry point

---

**Note**: These plans are preserved for future reference but are not actively being implemented.
