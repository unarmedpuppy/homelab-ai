# Polymarket Bot Strategy Improvements Plan

**Date:** 2025-12-15
**Status:** Observability Phase COMPLETE - Strategy improvements ready for review

## Summary

Based on analysis of successful trade execution and comparison with gabagool22's strategy ($270k+ profit), this plan outlines improvements to our trading bot.

---

## ✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXED: Untracked Partial Fills

### The Problem (RESOLVED)

Trades were executing on Polymarket but the bot thought they failed:

| Time (UTC) | Bot Log | Polymarket API |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| 14:36:51 | "Trade failed: FOK rejected" | BUY DOWN 29.29 @ $0.35 ✅ |
| 14:40:25 | "Trade failed: FOK rejected" | BUY UP 26.16 @ $0.63 ✅ |
| 15:05:29 | "Trade failed: FOK rejected" | BUY DOWN 25.48 @ $0.75 ✅ |

### Root Cause (FIXED)

The dual-leg execution flow had a critical flaw in `place_order_sync()`:

```
BEFORE FIX:
1. Bot sends YES order → FILLS ✅
2. Bot sends NO order → EXCEPTION raised by py-clob-client
3. asyncio.gather raises → outer try/except catches
4. Returns success=False, partial_fill=False → NO database record
5. BUT: YES order already executed on-chain!

AFTER FIX:
1. Bot sends YES order → FILLS ✅
2. Bot sends NO order → Exception caught in place_order_sync()
3. Returns {"status": "EXCEPTION", ...} instead of raising
4. Parallel execution completes, detects partial fill
5. Records partial fill to database AND settlement queue
```

### Fix Applied

- Modified `place_order_sync()` in `src/client/polymarket.py` to catch exceptions and return error dict
- Partial fills now properly detected and recorded
- Historical untracked positions can be reconciled via `scripts/reconcile_trades.py --fix`

---

## ✅ Observability Improvement Plan (COMPLETE)

### Phase A: External Trade Reconciliation ✅ COMPLETE

**Delivered:**
1. ✅ `scripts/reconcile_trades.py` - Standalone reconciliation script
   - Fetches trades from Polymarket Data API
   - Compares with local DB (trades + settlement_queue)
   - `--fix` flag adds untracked positions to settlement queue
   - `--json` flag for programmatic output
   - `--days N` to control lookback window
2. ✅ `/dashboard/reconciliation` endpoint - Real-time reconciliation via API
3. ✅ Dashboard widget showing discrepancies

### Phase B: Fix Partial Fill Detection ✅ COMPLETE

**Delivered:**
1. ✅ `place_order_sync()` catches exceptions, returns error dict
2. ✅ Partial fills detected when one leg fills and other throws exception
3. ✅ Partial fills recorded to database AND settlement queue

### Phase C: Dashboard Improvements ✅ COMPLETE

**Delivered:**
1. ✅ **Reconciliation Status Panel** - Shows untracked positions count, value, status
2. ✅ **RECON status indicator** in header (green/yellow/red based on discrepancies)
3. ✅ **Historical Positions Panel** - Shows settlement queue data
4. ✅ `/dashboard/positions` endpoint - Returns settlement history
5. ✅ REFRESH button for manual reconciliation checks

---

## Implementation Priority (Updated)

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| **P0** | Create reconciliation script | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **P0** | Fix partial fill recording | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **P1** | Dashboard reconciliation widget | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **P1** | Historical positions panel | ✅ COMPLETE |
| **P2** | Add trade verification | Deferred (reconciliation covers this) |

---

## Completed Items (This Session)

### 1. Critical Bug Fix - OrderBookSummary Compatibility
- **Issue:** `'OrderBookSummary' object has no attribute 'get'` crashed all trade executions
- **Fix:** Added `hasattr()` checks in `gabagool.py` and `polymarket.py` to handle both dict and object returns from py-clob-client
- **Status:** ✅ Deployed

### 2. Auto-Claim System
- **Finding:** Already implemented! Runs every 60s, sells at $0.99 after market ends
- **Issue:** Bug above prevented positions from being tracked in settlement_queue
- **Status:** ✅ Should work now that bug is fixed

### 3. User Activity Scraper Skill
- **Created:** `scripts/polymarket-user-activity.py`
- **Usage:** `python scripts/polymarket-user-activity.py <wallet> --days 7 --analyze`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

### 4. Trade Reconciliation Script
- **Created:** `apps/polymarket-bot/scripts/reconcile_trades.py`
- **Purpose:** Fetch trades from Polymarket API, compare with local DB, find untracked positions
- **Usage:**
  ```bash
  python scripts/reconcile_trades.py              # Show discrepancies
  python scripts/reconcile_trades.py --fix        # Add to settlement queue
  python scripts/reconcile_trades.py --json       # JSON output
  python scripts/reconcile_trades.py --days 14    # Custom lookback
  ```
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

### 5. Dashboard Observability Widgets
- **Historical Positions Panel:** Shows settlement queue with claimed/unclaimed status
- **Reconciliation Status Panel:** Shows untracked positions, value at risk, RECON indicator
- **New Endpoints:**
  - `/dashboard/positions` - Settlement queue history
  - `/dashboard/reconciliation` - Real-time reconciliation status
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

### 6. Partial Fill Detection Fix
- **Issue:** Exceptions in `place_order_sync()` caused `asyncio.gather` to raise, hiding partial fills
- **Fix:** Catch exceptions in `place_order_sync()`, return error dict instead of raising
- **File:** `src/client/polymarket.py`
- **Status:** ✅ Complete

## Gabagool22 Strategy Analysis

### Key Findings

1. **NOT Pure Arbitrage**
   - Gabagool22 does NOT achieve guaranteed profit on every trade
   - Many positions show negative expected value when hedged
   - Average spread paid: ~1-3% (LOSS, not profit)

2. **Strategy Appears to Be:**
   - High-frequency market making
   - Exploiting order flow information
   - Possibly directional betting with hedging
   - Volume-based edge (11k+ trades)

3. **Trade Characteristics:**
   - Small position sizes: 5-20 shares (avg 15)
   - Buys BOTH sides at different times/prices
   - 10,000 trades in ~1 hour of trading
   - No SELL trades in sample (holds to resolution or sells elsewhere)

4. **Why They're Profitable:**
   - Volume of trades captures small edges
   - Market making spread on some trades
   - Correct directional calls
   - Professional infrastructure (likely programmatic)

### Comparison to Our Strategy

| Aspect | Our Bot | Gabagool22 |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Position size | $10-50 | $3-8 (5-20 shares) |
| Trades per market | 1-2 | 10-100+ |
| Entry timing | Single entry | Gradual scaling |
| Spread requirement | >5% | Takes negative spread |
| Profit mechanism | Guaranteed arb | Volume + market making |

## Recommended Improvements

### Phase 1: Immediate (Low Risk)

#### 1.1 Reduce Position Sizes
- **Current:** $10-50 per trade
- **Recommended:** $3-5 per trade (5-10 shares)
- **Why:** Better fill rates, lower slippage, matches successful traders
- **Implementation:** Change `min_trade_size` and `max_trade_size` in config

```python
# In gabagool.py config
min_trade_size_usd: 3.0  # was 10
max_trade_size_usd: 5.0  # was 50
```

#### 1.2 Tighten Slippage Tolerance
- **Current:** Allowing some slippage
- **Recommended:** 0% slippage, cancel unfilled orders
- **Why:** Gabagool22's success comes from precise execution
- **Implementation:** Set `max_slippage: 0.0` in config

#### 1.3 Monitor Settlement Queue
- **Action:** Add dashboard visibility for pending settlements
- **Why:** Verify auto-claim is working after bug fix

### Phase 2: Strategy Enhancements (Medium Risk)

#### 2.1 Gradual Position Building
- **Current:** Single entry attempt
- **Recommended:** Scale into positions over time
- **Implementation:** Add `position_scaling` config option

```python
# Entry strategy
if spread_opportunity:
    for i in range(3):  # 3 smaller entries
        place_order(size=base_size/3, delay=30)  # Spread over 90 seconds
```

#### 2.2 Multi-Market Parallelization
- **Current:** Sequential market processing
- **Recommended:** Parallel order placement across markets
- **Why:** Capture more opportunities simultaneously

#### 2.3 Order Book Depth Analysis
- **Current:** Look at top of book
- **Recommended:** Analyze multiple levels for better entry
- **Why:** Find better prices deeper in the book

### Phase 3: Advanced (Higher Risk)

#### 3.1 Market Making Mode
- **Description:** Place limit orders on both sides
- **Risk:** Requires more capital, inventory risk
- **Potential:** Higher volume, spread capture

#### 3.2 Directional Bias
- **Description:** Weight positions based on market signals
- **Risk:** No longer guaranteed profit
- **Potential:** Higher returns if signals are accurate

## Implementation Order

### ✅ COMPLETED (This Session)
1. ✅ Trade reconciliation script (`scripts/reconcile_trades.py`)
2. ✅ Dashboard observability widgets (Historical Positions, Reconciliation Status)
3. ✅ Partial fill detection fix in `polymarket.py`
4. ✅ Documentation updates (STRATEGY_ARCHITECTURE.md, polymarket-bot-agent.md)

### ✅ Phase 1 Strategy Improvements (COMPLETE 2025-12-15)
1. ✅ **Position size reduction (1.1):** Added `min_trade_size_usd` config parameter
   - Default $3.0 min trade size (was hardcoded at $1.0)
   - Configurable via `GABAGOOL_MIN_TRADE_SIZE` env var
   - Budget enforcement: skip trades when budget < min_trade_size * 2
   - Regression tests in `tests/test_phase1_position_sizing.py`
2. ✅ **Zero slippage (1.2):** Already in production (`GABAGOOL_MAX_SLIPPAGE=0.0`)
3. ✅ **Max trade size (1.1):** Already in production (`GABAGOOL_MAX_TRADE_SIZE=5.0`)

### ✅ Phase 2 Strategy Improvements (COMPLETE 2025-12-15)
1. ✅ **Gradual position building (2.1):** Split trades into tranches (back-to-back, NO delays)
   - `gradual_entry_enabled` config (default: false)
   - `gradual_entry_tranches` = 3 (split into 3 smaller orders)
   - `gradual_entry_min_spread_cents` = 3.0 (only for spreads >= 3¢)
   - **Note:** Delays were removed - they let the spread escape
   - Regression tests in `tests/test_phase2_gradual_entry.py`
   - Disabled by default for safety - enable in production when ready

### 🔜 NEXT STEPS (Strategy Improvements)
1. **Monitor current state:** Use reconciliation to verify bot is now tracking trades correctly
2. **Enable gradual entry:** Set `GABAGOOL_GRADUAL_ENTRY_ENABLED=true` in production

### ⏸️ DEFERRED (Phase 3)
- **Multi-market parallelization (2.2):** Parallel order placement across markets
  - See: [parallel-markets-plan.md](./parallel-markets-plan.md) for full design
  - Worker pool architecture with BudgetManager for thread-safe capital reservation
  - Will implement when scaling to more markets

### 📋 FUTURE (Medium Risk)
- Order book depth analysis (2.3)
- Market making mode (3.1)
- Directional bias (3.2)

## Config Changes for Phase 1

```yaml
# apps/polymarket-bot/.env changes
GABAGOOL_MIN_TRADE_SIZE=3.0
GABAGOOL_MAX_TRADE_SIZE=5.0
GABAGOOL_MAX_SLIPPAGE=0.0
```

---

## Questions for Review

1. Do you want to proceed with Phase 1 changes immediately?
2. Should we test with even smaller sizes ($1-2) first?
3. Do you want to add a "test mode" for new strategies?
4. Interest in implementing market making mode (Phase 3)?
