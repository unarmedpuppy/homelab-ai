## Lesson Learned: Warn Before Extended Tasks

Joshua flagged that I got stuck in a deep loop (Twilio webhook/voice call setup) which blocked my ability to respond to iMessages. Going forward: warn before starting tasks that may take extended time or involve complex loops. Get explicit approval before proceeding with tangential work.

## Lesson Learned: Verify Correct Chat for Responses

Joshua noted I responded to his direct chat instead of the group chat. Same user may be in multiple chats. Always verify the originating chat and respond there. For family-related items, confirm if group chat (chat 4) is preferred.

## Operating Procedure: Group Chat Source Check

Joshua established: Always check group chat (chat 4) history before responding to any family member message. Determines correct response destination. Critical for seamless interaction when Abby starts using the system.
