## Known Issues

**Current Status**: ⚠️ **NOT WORKING** - Habitica v5.42.1 has a compatibility issue with Node.js 20 where `__dirname` is not available in ES module scope. This is a known issue in the Habitica codebase.

**Workarounds**:
- Wait for Habitica to release a fix for this issue
- Use an older version of Habitica that doesn't have this ES module issue
- Manually patch the code to fix the `__dirname` issue in ES modules

The service is deployed and configured, but the application cannot start until this compatibility issue is resolved.
