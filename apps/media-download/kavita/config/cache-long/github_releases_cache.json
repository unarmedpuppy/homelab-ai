    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003EThis is a massive release that Amelia and I have been working on for the past 3 months non-stop. If you recall from the last release notes, I said I wanted to focus on Feature Requests and so we picked up a few of the most popular requests: \u003Cstrong\u003EOIDC\u003C/strong\u003E (170\u002B upvotes), \u003Cstrong\u003ECustom fonts for Epub reader\u003C/strong\u003E (25\u002B upvotes), and \u003Cstrong\u003EHighlight/Annotation system\u003C/strong\u003E (40\u002B upvotes). This is a feature packed release, so buckle up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EEpub Reader Refresh\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, let\u0027s start with the new Epub reader. When tackling Annotations, we took the opportunity to refresh the UX and the underlying codebase, since it has been 5 years from when I originally wrote it. While tackling a new UI, I thought to also tackle some long standing, hard to reproduce issues, like text bleeding. Text bleeding ended up eating 3 weeks of pure madness as Amelia and I tried to fix (or just reproduce reliably), until we opened a bug bounty and @privatestefans fixed it. Even with all the pain, we brought some requested features around bookmarking images in the reader as well. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EEpub Fonts\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cimg width=\u00221637\u0022 height=\u0022687\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/903730c2-3c1a-4a06-bcf5-34112b7c0efc\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been a constant ask from many users and we finally got it out. From the font management screen, any user can download fonts to use within their books. Either upload a font file or better, copy/paste a Google Fonts url. Fonts can then be assigned to books via reading profiles. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOIDC\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cimg width=\u00222940\u0022 height=\u00221618\u0022 alt=\u0022login screen with OIDC enable\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f1d8abb-da43-46fc-9a00-9bbb402b33dd\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003Cp align=\u0022center\u0022\u003E\r\n   \u003Cimg width=\u0022592\u0022 height=\u0022757\u0022 alt=\u0022some of the OIDC configuration options\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c85723d1-cf5b-4381-b4c7-03454d207786\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release introduces one of our most requested features to date: OpenID Connect (OIDC/SSO) integration. Server admins can now configure OIDC to work alongside or fully replace Kavita\u2019s native authentication system. The setup is designed to be straightforward to get it up and running quickly, while still offering advanced configuration options for those who need more control.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdmins can choose to enable automatic account creation, allowing users to join the server without manual intervention. When active, newly created accounts inherit the configured default roles and age restrictions. For more fine-grained control, role syncing can be enabled\u2014bypassing defaults in favor of permissions defined by the identity provider, so you can manage all user access centrally.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERead all about it on the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki.kavitareader.com/guides/admin-settings/open-id-connect/\u0022\u003Ewiki\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe Annotation System\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cimg width=\u00221916\u0022 height=\u0022378\u0022 alt=\u0022edit-annotation-drawer\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae4c4137-9c78-493d-afab-4633db186ca7\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003Cimg width=\u00221006\u0022 height=\u0022925\u0022 alt=\u0022annotation-drawer\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/083dc4b6-09fd-4395-bce2-79ff8f756d4a\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EUsers have been asking for the ability to highlight text and add notes when they read and have expressed a strong need for a software in the self-hosting community to tackle this need. Since the start of the epub reader 5 years ago, I wanted this system (and even solved the implementation), but never had time to tackle it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe annotation system is currently implemented for the epub reader and it will be for the foreseeable future. It offers a way to highlight any passage of text and to write a comment about that with rich text (bold, underline, lists, images, etc). You can see any annotation within the reader to jump around, you can view from the series page or the new All Annotations view (accessible from the user menu in the top right). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnnotations have an owner, a marker if there are spoilers in the comment, and a highlight slot. There are a fixed 5 highlight slots with predefined colors, but you can change them at any time. Since annotations are bound to the slot number, you can change the color system and all annotations will get that update. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita also added some social aspects that are opt-in. You can opt-in to share your reviews with users on the server (with some extra restrictions on libraries and age ratings) and also opt-in to seeing other users\u0027 annotations. If you do opt-in to viewing, you can also upvote ones you agree with. Filtering and Sorting against these fields are planned for v0.8.8, due to a dependency on a feature in .NET 10. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, Annotations can be exported (either everything or a filtered set of Annotations) in JSON format. I took inspiration from other Obsidian plugins. While I am not going to write an Obsidian importer myself, if someone does, I\u0027m open to working with you to get the best experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOPDS Love\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOPDS has gotten a lot of polish and love from me this release. I had originally dived in to finally polish the Koreader sync experience, but caught swept up in polishing the experience, along with a few FRs from users that I think has brought a lot of UX to Kavita\u0027s implementation. First, pagination across the board. Not all apps support this unfortunately, which is where our next item shines: \u003Cstrong\u003EContinue From\u003C/strong\u003E. This new item will be first and foremost if you have any reading progress in the feed. It is a shortcut to avoiding having to scroll hundreds of items. Kavita now also encoded progress icons into the titles to make it easier (since clients are also very loose with supporting metadata). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat\u0027s Next\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release was quite challenging with the epub reader overhaul, but extremely satisfying polish and fix many outstanding issues. I can\u0027t wait to hear the feedback on the new annotation system. I want to extend a huge thanks again to our nightly testers and those that provided feedback for the annotation system (and OIDC support). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext release I want to continue with my original plan of tackling more of Kavita\u002B and it\u0027s integration in Kavita, along with the backend switching to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mangabaka.org?utm_source=kavita\u0022\u003EMangaBaka\u003C/a\u003E, focusing on a new Progress system to allow for richer stats, and a few more Feature Requests that didn\u0027t make it this release. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added OIDC Authentication support.

If you recall from the last release notes, I said I wanted to focus on Feature Requests and so we picked up a few of the most popular requests: \u003Cstrong\u003EOIDC\u003C/strong\u003E (170\u002B upvotes), \u003Cstrong\u003ECustom fonts for Epub reader\u003C/strong\u003E (25\u002B upvotes), and \u003Cstrong\u003EHighlight/Annotation system\u003C/strong\u003E (40\u002B upvotes). This is a feature packed release, so buckle up.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EEpub Reader Refresh\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, let\u0027s start with the new Epub reader. When tackling Annotations, we took the opportunity to refresh the UX and the underlying codebase, since it has been 5 years from when I originally wrote it. While tackling a new UI, I thought to also tackle some long standing, hard to reproduce issues, like text bleeding. Text bleeding ended up eating 3 weeks of pure madness as Amelia and I tried to fix (or just reproduce reliably), until we opened a bug bounty and @privatestefans fixed it. Even with all the pain, we brought some requested features around bookmarking images in the reader as well. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EEpub Fonts\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cimg width=\u00221637\u0022 height=\u0022687\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/903730c2-3c1a-4a06-bcf5-34112b7c0efc\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis has been a constant ask from many users and we finally got it out. From the font management screen, any user can download fonts to use within their books. Either upload a font file or better, copy/paste a Google Fonts url. Fonts can then be assigned to books via reading profiles. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOIDC\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cimg width=\u00222940\u0022 height=\u00221618\u0022 alt=\u0022login screen with OIDC enable\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f1d8abb-da43-46fc-9a00-9bbb402b33dd\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003Cp align=\u0022center\u0022\u003E\r\n   \u003Cimg width=\u0022592\u0022 height=\u0022757\u0022 alt=\u0022some of the OIDC configuration options\u0022 src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c85723d1-cf5b-4381-b4c7-03454d207786\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003C/p\u003E\r\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release introduces one of our most requested features to date: OpenID Connect (OIDC/SSO) integration. Server admins can now configure OIDC to work alongside or fully replace Kavita\u2019s native authentication system.

Since the start of the epub reader 5 years ago, I wanted this system (and even solved the implementation), but never had time to tackle it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe annotation system is currently implemented for the epub reader and it will be for the foreseeable future. It offers a way to highlight any passage of text and to write a comment about that with rich text (bold, underline, lists, images, etc). You can see any annotation within the reader to jump around, you can view from the series page or the new All Annotations view (accessible from the user menu in the top right). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnnotations have an owner, a marker if there are spoilers in the comment, and a highlight slot. There are a fixed 5 highlight slots with predefined colors, but you can change them at any time. Since annotations are bound to the slot number, you can change the color system and all annotations will get that update. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita also added some social aspects that are opt-in. You can opt-in to share your reviews with users on the server (with some extra restrictions on libraries and age ratings) and also opt-in to seeing other users\u0027 annotations. If you do opt-in to viewing, you can also upvote ones you agree with. Filtering and Sorting against these fields are planned for v0.8.8, due to a dependency on a feature in .NET 10. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, Annotations can be exported (either everything or a filtered set of Annotations) in JSON format. I took inspiration from other Obsidian plugins. While I am not going to write an Obsidian importer myself, if someone does, I\u0027m open to working with you to get the best experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOPDS Love\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOPDS has gotten a lot of polish and love from me this release. I had originally dived in to finally polish the Koreader sync experience, but caught swept up in polishing the experience, along with a few FRs from users that I think has brought a lot of UX to Kavita\u0027s implementation. First, pagination across the board. Not all apps support this unfortunately, which is where our next item shines: \u003Cstrong\u003EContinue From\u003C/strong\u003E. This new item will be first and foremost if you have any reading progress in the feed. It is a shortcut to avoiding having to scroll hundreds of items. Kavita now also encoded progress icons into the titles to make it easier (since clients are also very loose with supporting metadata). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWhat\u0027s Next\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release was quite challenging with the epub reader overhaul, but extremely satisfying polish and fix many outstanding issues. I can\u0027t wait to hear the feedback on the new annotation system. I want to extend a huge thanks again to our nightly testers and those that provided feedback for the annotation system (and OIDC support). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext release I want to continue with my original plan of tackling more of Kavita\u002B and it\u0027s integration in Kavita, along with the backend switching to \u003Ca href=\u0022https://mangabaka.org?utm_source=kavita\u0022\u003EMangaBaka\u003C/a\u003E, focusing on a new Progress system to allow for richer stats, and a few more Feature Requests that didn\u0027t make it this release.\u003C/p\u003E\n"

    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003EThis was supposed to be Scanner Improvements, but due to my 2 week holiday in the middle, then getting massively distracted when I got back, we ended up with some nice features instead. This release is feature packed with a ton of Feature Requests: Comic Metadata for Kavita\u002B, Reading Profiles, Expanded Browse by support, Koreader Sync Support, Ability to disable metadata parsing (for those that want the old pdf parser), a revamped Mihon extension, and much more!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore we get started, I first want to announce that @Fesaa has officially joined the Kavita team. She has been a strong and continuous contributor for the last few months, she\u0027s also is behind one of the most requested FRs (Reading Profiles). Really excited to continue our work together to make Kavita the best software out there. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EComic Metadata (Kavita\u002B)\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e394d3fe-e56c-49ab-ae2b-7675b5aee4d2\u0022 alt=\u0022438843284-0fac5031-db71-48c6-9bde-0eaae1a2fb1c\u0022 /\u003E\r\nCan you believe everything you see is issue metadata from Kavita\u002B? In this release, I have expanded the metadata downloading functionality to Comics. You get Publisher, Imprint, People roles, Issue-level Reviews (Critic and User), Release Date, Cover Image, Issue Title, Average Rating, and summary. This metadata applies at the \u003Cstrong\u003Eseries\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Eissue\u003C/strong\u003E level. Data comes from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://comicbookroundup.com/\u0022\u003EComic Book Roundup\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavtia\u002B Comic data also has weekly release data, which is a nice added bonus. I am currently exploring if metadata around TPBs is useful. If you think it is, please create/upvote a FR and provide discussion to validate the work. I look forward to hearing if the Comic metadata is bringing value to you. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EBrowse (and filter) People/Genre/Tags\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce9a32b8-5e2d-4067-b544-f169c9ca3f8b\u0022 alt=\u0022455074614-d22a39a1-f92e-443b-aa58-27968d8ccf7a\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ecf27a0d-c8da-4abd-8d70-29e419d79f73\u0022 alt=\u0022455074644-6c1d2cfa-d92c-40aa-b77b-36a442b3457b\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this release, I\u0027ve also expanded the metadata system to People and provided what I thought was valuable items. Surprisingly, this took me about 40 hours to do, but now, the metadata system can work on any entity, so my plans for an issue/chapter page seem more feasible. In addition to this, you can now browse by Genre/Tags. Do note, anything with 0 series will not be further filterable by as there is no issue listing page yet. (You can reach the browse genre/tag screens from your user menu in top right of screen)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EReading Profiles\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8acd6566-523b-4a54-abd9-748fede93dcc\u0022 alt=\u0022452782185-0fe8ac41-ecd5-42ef-aabf-2b5b49c09ab2\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a massive feature delivering on a highly request Feature Request (100 upvotes). I want to thank Amelia for implementing it while I was on my holiday.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EReading Profiles capture your reader settings (image, pdf, epub) into an entity that can be bound to a set of Libraries and Series. With the new system, you can bind a reading profile to a library (say double page to your comic library). Now, whenever you read in that library, the double page reader will be applied. Likewise, you can bind a Reading Profile to a Series as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition, there are Implicit profiles. These aren\u0027t visual in the UI, but instead capture any changes that are made mid-reading session. Going forward, any changes made during reading will persist between reading sessions for that series itself. From the readers, you can \u0027promote\u0027 the implicit profile into a manageable (shows in the manage screen). You can also optionally skip the implicit and save to the parent profile (aka the series/library bound profile).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki has a great overview on how the new system works.

The original plugin was written by @ThePromidius, but hasn\u0027t been active for some time. @dear-clouds took it upon themselves to update the extension and bring some much needed polish.

Actionables across the app are now smarter. Instead of showing add and remove from collection, it will check the status and only present options that are applicable. \r\n2. Libraries by default will not import collections/reading lists from ComicInfo (Manage Collections/Reading Lists). Many support issues arose and since most of the community recommends using the CBL project, it makes sense to make this opt-in.\r\n3. There was a lot of bugfixing and polish around Kavita\u002B this release. Hopefully most issues plaguing users are solved. \r\n4.

    "BlogPart": "\u003Cp\u003EThis was supposed to be Scanner Improvements, but due to my 2 week holiday in the middle, then getting massively distracted when I got back, we ended up with some nice features instead. This release is feature packed with a ton of Feature Requests: Comic Metadata for Kavita\u002B, Reading Profiles, Expanded Browse by support, Koreader Sync Support, Ability to disable metadata parsing (for those that want the old pdf parser), a revamped Mihon extension, and much more!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore we get started, I first want to announce that @Fesaa has officially joined the Kavita team. She has been a strong and continuous contributor for the last few months, she\u0027s also is behind one of the most requested FRs (Reading Profiles). Really excited to continue our work together to make Kavita the best software out there. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EComic Metadata (Kavita\u002B)\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e394d3fe-e56c-49ab-ae2b-7675b5aee4d2\u0022 alt=\u0022438843284-0fac5031-db71-48c6-9bde-0eaae1a2fb1c\u0022 /\u003E\r\nCan you believe everything you see is issue metadata from Kavita\u002B? In this release, I have expanded the metadata downloading functionality to Comics. You get Publisher, Imprint, People roles, Issue-level Reviews (Critic and User), Release Date, Cover Image, Issue Title, Average Rating, and summary. This metadata applies at the \u003Cstrong\u003Eseries\u003C/strong\u003E and \u003Cstrong\u003Eissue\u003C/strong\u003E level. Data comes from \u003Ca href=\u0022https://comicbookroundup.com/\u0022\u003EComic Book Roundup\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavtia\u002B Comic data also has weekly release data, which is a nice added bonus. I am currently exploring if metadata around TPBs is useful. If you think it is, please create/upvote a FR and provide discussion to validate the work. I look forward to hearing if the Comic metadata is bringing value to you.\u003C/p\u003E\n"

    "CurrentVersion": "0.8.8.3",
    "UpdateVersion": "0.8.6",
    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003Ev0.8.6 is here and it\u0027s only fair to call this the Spring-Cleaning release as over the past 3 weeks, Amelia (@Fesaa) and I have closed out 65 issues from Github and polished a ton of the app. This release is packed with a lot of OLD issues finally being tackled and a few of them are quite annoying, so let\u0027s get started with the breakdown. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let\u0027s talk about the few enhancements that made it into the release. One of these enhancements was around Smart Filters and removing them from your customize list or renaming them. Both are features that weren\u0027t thought about in the initial implementation and just kept slipping through the cracks. Amelia took it upon herself to not only implement but also add some drag and drop reordering on the side nav for those that don\u0027t want to go into customize screen. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother nice enhancement is around Media Errors. I implemented Media Errors after being inspired by Komga feature, but never gave it much more thought after that. You know what\u0027s annoying? Having 300 media errors that aren\u0027t actually reflective of the state of your media. The original thought was manually clearing the alerts, but why can\u0027t Kavita just do most of those checks for you? So that\u0027s what this feature brings. Kavita will check if files were successfully imported with at least 1 page or 1 word and clear out the issue for you. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last big enhancement is around Reading Lists. I\u0027m not a huge reading list user, but the folks over in CBL project have been discussing some polish that is needed and raised a great \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/discussions/3671\u0022\u003EFeature Request\u003C/a\u003E. Some of these were no-brainers, so I took a few days and implemented some much-needed polish and exposed more metadata around the reading list. My favorite is not being in edit mode by default. If you have ideas on how to make the Reading List experience better, please add your ideas to the Feature Request. I have already confirmed I will be doing a big overhaul once I have a good picture of the features user\u0027s want and need. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the enhancements out of the way, let\u0027s focus on the meat of this release, the bugfixes and polish. I\u0027ll open with one I know many readers are going to enjoy--the webtoon reader finally tracks the last page read when using the continuous reader 100% of the time. The nightly users and I tested this by reading a combined 700 chapters (500 of those were just @duplaja, go figures). Shoutout to @reinar for providing some code that helped me get the needed fix. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother major fix, with the help yet again of Amelia, is the localization fix. Non-English locales have been having issues with Kavita for the last few releases and due to me not being able to reproduce the issues, I used a shotgun approach to fixing the issue. Luckily Amelia has such a setup and was able to fix it. Docker users can now remove the \u003Ccode\u003EDOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=true\u003C/code\u003E from their compose file and Kavita should work across the board. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EDocker users\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERemove \u003Ccode\u003EDOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=true\u003C/code\u003E from your compose files. It is no longer needed. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, Amelia polished a lot of the UI for the epub reader, closing out some annoying issues around scrolling, especially on iOS (which I cannot test against) and I focused on the backend, allowing for loosened parsing requirements, but still reporting the issue to Media Errors (Thanks to @vers-one for enhancing their library). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis overall feels like a great release with a lot of polish and stability. Many other issues were fixed, and I feel very confident in this release. The next release is planned to focus on the Scanner and see if some more instability can be ironed out and apply some more performance improvements.

    "BlogPart": "\u003Cp\u003Ev0.8.6 is here and it\u0027s only fair to call this the Spring-Cleaning release as over the past 3 weeks, Amelia (@Fesaa) and I have closed out 65 issues from Github and polished a ton of the app. This release is packed with a lot of OLD issues finally being tackled and a few of them are quite annoying, so let\u0027s get started with the breakdown. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst, let\u0027s talk about the few enhancements that made it into the release. One of these enhancements was around Smart Filters and removing them from your customize list or renaming them. Both are features that weren\u0027t thought about in the initial implementation and just kept slipping through the cracks. Amelia took it upon herself to not only implement but also add some drag and drop reordering on the side nav for those that don\u0027t want to go into customize screen. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother nice enhancement is around Media Errors. I implemented Media Errors after being inspired by Komga feature, but never gave it much more thought after that. You know what\u0027s annoying? Having 300 media errors that aren\u0027t actually reflective of the state of your media. The original thought was manually clearing the alerts, but why can\u0027t Kavita just do most of those checks for you? So that\u0027s what this feature brings. Kavita will check if files were successfully imported with at least 1 page or 1 word and clear out the issue for you. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last big enhancement is around Reading Lists. I\u0027m not a huge reading list user, but the folks over in CBL project have been discussing some polish that is needed and raised a great \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/discussions/3671\u0022\u003EFeature Request\u003C/a\u003E. Some of these were no-brainers, so I took a few days and implemented some much-needed polish and exposed more metadata around the reading list. My favorite is not being in edit mode by default. If you have ideas on how to make the Reading List experience better, please add your ideas to the Feature Request. I have already confirmed I will be doing a big overhaul once I have a good picture of the features user\u0027s want and need. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith the enhancements out of the way, let\u0027s focus on the meat of this release, the bugfixes and polish. I\u0027ll open with one I know many readers are going to enjoy--the webtoon reader finally tracks the last page read when using the continuous reader 100% of the time. The nightly users and I tested this by reading a combined 700 chapters (500 of those were just @duplaja, go figures). Shoutout to @reinar for providing some code that helped me get the needed fix. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother major fix, with the help yet again of Amelia, is the localization fix. Non-English locales have been having issues with Kavita for the last few releases and due to me not being able to reproduce the issues, I used a shotgun approach to fixing the issue. Luckily Amelia has such a setup and was able to fix it. Docker users can now remove the \u003Ccode\u003EDOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=true\u003C/code\u003E from their compose file and Kavita should work across the board. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EDocker users\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERemove \u003Ccode\u003EDOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=true\u003C/code\u003E from your compose files. It is no longer needed. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, Amelia polished a lot of the UI for the epub reader, closing out some annoying issues around scrolling, especially on iOS (which I cannot test against) and I focused on the backend, allowing for loosened parsing requirements, but still reporting the issue to Media Errors (Thanks to @vers-one for enhancing their library). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis overall feels like a great release with a lot of polish and stability. Many other issues were fixed, and I feel very confident in this release. The next release is planned to focus on the Scanner and see if some more instability can be ironed out and apply some more performance improvements. Amelia and I have been brainstorming and doing some research to see what overhauls we can make. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly I want to end with an update that my time is still extremely constrained and will likely be this way going forward, so expect longer windows between releases.\u003C/p\u003E\n"

    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been some time since the last release and this one is hefty! The goal of this release is to overhaul Kavita\u002B experience within Kavita, but I sneaked in metadata downloading, something I originally envisioned for Kavita, as well. This release is packed with a lot of goodies, from the ability to download metadata, greatly improving the PDF experience, to decreasing the scrobble window from 4 hours to 1 hour, and much more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMetadata Downloading (Kavita\u002B)\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first started Kavita, I talked about wanting to build a plugin system to support metadata downloading, so I could have a true Plex experience. As the application and user base grew, the Plugin system was too much scope for me to handle and I said goodbye to the idea. Luckily, Kavita\u002B is here to provide that opportunity to build it out and all of last year, I have been slowly laying the foundation to make it a reality. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita can now automatically download metadata and apply it to your Series. It currently supports 12 different fields, including Cover Image, People, Genres, Tags, Age Ratings, and Relationships to name a few. I wanted to build a system that was functional but simple. Kavita offers a few controls that should allow enough flexibility to work for most users. I want to also thank the community for the overwhelming testing and feedback. The nightly testers and community really brought a lot of great ideas to polish this feature off. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, I want to set expectations. I\u0027m not looking to build a komf replacement. This will currently just use metadata from AniList/MAL and Hardcover once I get around to it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how does it work? \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPDF Metadata\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pains of PDF may finally be over! Kavita now can read PDF metadata when tagged with Calibre (there is no real metadata format). Thanks to @microtherion writing a custom PDF parser, Kavita can now extract Series, title, volume, genres, etc from your files and bring a good experience for people forced to use PDFs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ENew Stats API\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release also sees the release of an overhauled stat system. The Stats API is mainly for understanding how many servers are running Kavita, but there is also a lot of benefit in collecting anonymous data about the users of Kavita. On multiple occasions, I base decisions for features or bugs based on that data. However, the original stats API was quite out of date with what was important, so I overhauled it drastically. Like always, the code is Open source and nothing is logged that can identify you. You can take a look at the stat record \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/KavitaStats/pull/67\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. Thank you to all that continue to report statistics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMisc\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to shout out a few extra features that are included in this release. First off, Automatic Webtoon mode switching. This is a very common issue for users that read by comics and webtoons and also a discovery issue for new users. While I had architected out a grand solution for this, due to time constraints it never came. This is a good hold over until that time comes. When Kavita opens a comic that is likely a webtoon, it will switch into the mode for you automatically. It\u0027s not 100%, but a best guess. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother new feature is bringing Bionic Reading mode to Kavita\u0027s epub reader via a new font. A few users asked for this and thankfully a font made it possible. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EDocker Fix\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the last release, docker users reported the scanner breaking. You can fix this with the following. The wiki reflects this as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd \u003Ccode\u003EDOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=true\u003C/code\u003E to your docker compose\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThis Year\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, let\u0027s talk about what I want to deliver this year. I have to preface this by saying that this year my time is extremely constrained. But as always, I have lots of ideas that I want to try and accomplish. Since my time is limited, I\u0027ve scaled down my goals to 2 main features:\r\n1. \u003Cstrong\u003EJournal-style Progress\u003C/strong\u003E will allow for a much richer stats experience and allow for some new functionalities in reading history. I\u0027ve already validated this architecture in another project so it shouldn\u0027t be too complex porting back to Kavita. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKobo Sync\u003C/strong\u003E was on my list last year but due to the new scanner, got pushed away. With the news of Kindle, it seems like a great time to prioritize it to the front of the list. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese two features are a blend of user wants and my own wants to enable much richer statistics in the application. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll get side tracked along the way and deliver something cool. As always, a big thank you to our users and community. Kavita would not be where it is without your comments, feedback, and ideas. I\u0027m really grateful that I have a great community, looking forward to working with you this year. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote: AniList API is currently degraded and stuck at 30 requests / min. I\u0027ve tried to build out the cache to avoid having to hit them for the release. Please be patient, I will be continuing my work on Kavita\u002B to work around these API limits.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWith metadata being available for PDF, you may loose progress. When v0.8.5 starts, it will export all progress to config/progress_export-v0.8.5.csv\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/942d0640-eb36-4523-93bc-d3f882ae29cc\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b6ade48-8036-4d0b-b473-bddaf6b10bc2\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/419955c1-9557-44e2-b329-dba43fb2b050\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4133c843-cc74-4cb6-96b0-5d1c43fa1d61\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added Fast Font to Book Reader.

This also takes care of any transloco hacks to clear the cache. This should help on update day for non-admin users to get the latest UI code files.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a new long term cache directory (cache-long). Currently storing Github release history information.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) Complete overhaul to the Kavita\u002B license page. Not only will you have the main license flow, but Kavita will pull down information about your subscription, including the registered email, total sub length, when the expiration will be, and if you\u0027re on a valid Kavita install version. Surfaced some of the actionable buttons with descriptions to hopefully help drive more management through the software instead of emailing me.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added long term caching for Publisher/Favicon fallback so CoversDb doesn\u0027t have to service more requests than needed.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) There is now a manual match flow in Kavita to match a series (or fix a match) to AniList (currently the only upstream provider till Hardcover). Kavita still tries to match automatically, but via this new action from Series detail page, you can either provide another search name or Anilist/Mal urls directly to direct match.

    "BlogPart": "\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s been some time since the last release and this one is hefty! The goal of this release is to overhaul Kavita\u002B experience within Kavita, but I sneaked in metadata downloading, something I originally envisioned for Kavita, as well. This release is packed with a lot of goodies, from the ability to download metadata, greatly improving the PDF experience, to decreasing the scrobble window from 4 hours to 1 hour, and much more. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMetadata Downloading (Kavita\u002B)\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I first started Kavita, I talked about wanting to build a plugin system to support metadata downloading, so I could have a true Plex experience. As the application and user base grew, the Plugin system was too much scope for me to handle and I said goodbye to the idea. Luckily, Kavita\u002B is here to provide that opportunity to build it out and all of last year, I have been slowly laying the foundation to make it a reality. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita can now automatically download metadata and apply it to your Series. It currently supports 12 different fields, including Cover Image, People, Genres, Tags, Age Ratings, and Relationships to name a few. I wanted to build a system that was functional but simple. Kavita offers a few controls that should allow enough flexibility to work for most users. I want to also thank the community for the overwhelming testing and feedback. The nightly testers and community really brought a lot of great ideas to polish this feature off. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, I want to set expectations. I\u0027m not looking to build a komf replacement. This will currently just use metadata from AniList/MAL and Hardcover once I get around to it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo how does it work? \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPDF Metadata\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe pains of PDF may finally be over! Kavita now can read PDF metadata when tagged with Calibre (there is no real metadata format). Thanks to @microtherion writing a custom PDF parser, Kavita can now extract Series, title, volume, genres, etc from your files and bring a good experience for people forced to use PDFs. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ENew Stats API\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release also sees the release of an overhauled stat system. The Stats API is mainly for understanding how many servers are running Kavita, but there is also a lot of benefit in collecting anonymous data about the users of Kavita. On multiple occasions, I base decisions for features or bugs based on that data. However, the original stats API was quite out of date with what was important, so I overhauled it drastically. Like always, the code is Open source and nothing is logged that can identify you. You can take a look at the stat record \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/KavitaStats/pull/67\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E. Thank you to all that continue to report statistics. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMisc\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI wanted to shout out a few extra features that are included in this release. First off, Automatic Webtoon mode switching. This is a very common issue for users that read by comics and webtoons and also a discovery issue for new users. While I had architected out a grand solution for this, due to time constraints it never came. This is a good hold over until that time comes. When Kavita opens a comic that is likely a webtoon, it will switch into the mode for you automatically. It\u0027s not 100%, but a best guess. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother new feature is bringing Bionic Reading mode to Kavita\u0027s epub reader via a new font. A few users asked for this and thankfully a font made it possible. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EDocker Fix\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the last release, docker users reported the scanner breaking. You can fix this with the following. The wiki reflects this as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cblockquote\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAdd \u003Ccode\u003EDOTNET_SYSTEM_GLOBALIZATION_INVARIANT=true\u003C/code\u003E to your docker compose\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/blockquote\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThis Year\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, let\u0027s talk about what I want to deliver this year. I have to preface this by saying that this year my time is extremely constrained. But as always, I have lots of ideas that I want to try and accomplish. Since my time is limited, I\u0027ve scaled down my goals to 2 main features:\r\n1. \u003Cstrong\u003EJournal-style Progress\u003C/strong\u003E will allow for a much richer stats experience and allow for some new functionalities in reading history. I\u0027ve already validated this architecture in another project so it shouldn\u0027t be too complex porting back to Kavita. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Col\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EKobo Sync\u003C/strong\u003E was on my list last year but due to the new scanner, got pushed away. With the news of Kindle, it seems like a great time to prioritize it to the front of the list. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ol\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese two features are a blend of user wants and my own wants to enable much richer statistics in the application. I\u0027m sure I\u0027ll get side tracked along the way and deliver something cool. As always, a big thank you to our users and community. Kavita would not be where it is without your comments, feedback, and ideas. I\u0027m really grateful that I have a great community, looking forward to working with you this year. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ENote: AniList API is currently degraded and stuck at 30 requests / min. I\u0027ve tried to build out the cache to avoid having to hit them for the release. Please be patient, I will be continuing my work on Kavita\u002B to work around these API limits.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EWith metadata being available for PDF, you may loose progress. When v0.8.5 starts, it will export all progress to config/progress_export-v0.8.5.csv\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/942d0640-eb36-4523-93bc-d3f882ae29cc\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b6ade48-8036-4d0b-b473-bddaf6b10bc2\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/419955c1-9557-44e2-b329-dba43fb2b050\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4133c843-cc74-4cb6-96b0-5d1c43fa1d61\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

    "UpdateVersion": "0.8.4",
    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003EAfter rewriting 50K lines of code last release, I decided it was best to take a break and focus on the bugs that resulted and a few that had piled up. This release is bug focused, but of course I stuck a few big features in with it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EScanner\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne issue that has been cropping up as we attract more users with larger libraries or libraries laid out in the Publisher/Series style is the scanner. Users with large libraries modify their library quite a bit and the old scanner had issues with change detection. v0.8.3 had quite a nasty bug which required forced library scans to ingest new data. There was also the notorious FK issue that was more common for larger libraries. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo fix these issues, I rewrote the scanner from the ground up to be more reliable. This was a (painful) 3 week effort working closely with a dedicated set of testers on a canary release to be nightly and stable ready. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe new scanner will be slower than the old one.\u003C/strong\u003E As of now, I feel that once the main slow first scan is done, it\u0027s actually performing much better. With this new scanner, there were some other major changes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPeople Re-architecture\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to reduce the FK issue in the scanner, I also needed to tackle the 80\u002B hour re-architecture of how people work within Kavita. When I started, with my limited knowledge of the scene or what Kavita would grow to become, I implemented people as tags, much like how ComicInfo does. This is constrained when you want to make people more entity-focused, like having a dedicated page for them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this release, you can now view individual details of a person, set a cover and description about the person and see their works and individual issues they worked on. You can also browse authors and artists, like other software has. This is just the start, please leave feedback for me via Feature Requests, so I can build this feature out more and make it a richer experience. \u003Cstrong\u003ENote: Any Smart Filters that relied on people will need manual intervention to correct. A force scan will be required to regenerate writer information.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/992c5451-08c3-45c5-81ce-4426967d3127\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1a06eb8-ddde-44f6-98c2-98315b252494\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ESpecial Keyword Removal\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last thing with the scanner was removing Kavita\u0027s ability to detect and classify certain keywords as Special. Like \u003Ccode\u003EOmake\u003C/code\u003E  or \u003Ccode\u003EAnnual\u003C/code\u003E would classify a file as a special. While this is extremely handy in the Manga scene, there were numerous reports over the years that required manual workarounds by users. In order to behave more reliably, I opened a discussion this year for removal and made the final call. \u003Cstrong\u003ESpecials going forward will need the SP marker on the filename (or tagged internally).\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ECoversDB\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita has had the ability to download and display favicon and publisher images with a fallback repository being hosted on the main Kavita website. In this release, I\u0027ve moved all that functionality and those images over to a new CoversDB \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/CoversDB\u0022\u003Erepo\u003C/a\u003E. This repo will be the home for anything related to pulling images for Kavita instances. I plan to enhance this further as new features come to Kavita.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ESmall QoL Features\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELast Read Filter\u003C/strong\u003E is a new feature that allows you to pass a number that will be subtracted from TODAY, upping the dynamic function and allowing users to build Smart Filters like \u0026quot;Haven\u0027t read in a month\u0026quot;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EColorscape Polish\u003C/strong\u003E The colorscape system has been polished even further. I spent a good amount of time adding some randomness, fixed a bug with colorscape resetting between navigation, and tried to tweak where colors go to avoid harsh contrasts. It\u0027s not perfect, but it\u0027s a step in the right direction. If you\u0027re passionate about the colorscape system, I welcome collaboration. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBulk Library Actions\u003C/strong\u003E This is something @DieselTech has been pushing me to add and the time is finally here. For users that have a lot of libraries (like Diesel and his 200\u002B), sometimes it\u0027s quite a pain to update the settings of them all or perform some actions. Now in Kavita there are some limited bulk options, like refreshing covers or copying settings from one library to another (Scan currently disabled). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2517e6f1-4548-4d30-ae23-17dc80688771\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ERecap\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release has been a ton of work on my part, but I felt it was important to squash the bugs first and ensure Kavita remains stable while I continue to add more features and bring a richer experience to users. My next release is still aimed at finishing the UX Overhaul with attention on Kavita\u002B. With the holidays coming up, it is expected that this will take longer than most releases. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those that have seen, we have hit over 65K active installs. It\u0027s absolutely amazing that a small project I started due to Ubooquity not having metadata has turned into such a massive project with a huge userbase. I want to give my thanks again to those in the community that have raised bugs, feature requests, give support in the discord/reddit, those who give me donations via OC/Kavita\u002B, the translators, and of course my wife that helps support me pouring so much time into the project. \u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027m excited to continue building Kavita and bring about more of our visions into the software and see what is possible.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPeople metadata will be removed on update. A force scan is required to repopulate in the new system. A force scan/first scan will be much slower than before.\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Manage Libraries now has bulk actions.

Shift\u002Bselect works as well.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a new page for all People within Kavita. From this page, you can see their works across Kavita.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Ability to see individual chapters/issues (limited to 20) a person has.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Ability to add images to the person via UI/API.

    "BlogPart": "\u003Cp\u003EAfter rewriting 50K lines of code last release, I decided it was best to take a break and focus on the bugs that resulted and a few that had piled up. This release is bug focused, but of course I stuck a few big features in with it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EScanner\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne issue that has been cropping up as we attract more users with larger libraries or libraries laid out in the Publisher/Series style is the scanner. Users with large libraries modify their library quite a bit and the old scanner had issues with change detection. v0.8.3 had quite a nasty bug which required forced library scans to ingest new data. There was also the notorious FK issue that was more common for larger libraries. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo fix these issues, I rewrote the scanner from the ground up to be more reliable. This was a (painful) 3 week effort working closely with a dedicated set of testers on a canary release to be nightly and stable ready. \u003Cstrong\u003EThe new scanner will be slower than the old one.\u003C/strong\u003E As of now, I feel that once the main slow first scan is done, it\u0027s actually performing much better. With this new scanner, there were some other major changes.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPeople Re-architecture\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to reduce the FK issue in the scanner, I also needed to tackle the 80\u002B hour re-architecture of how people work within Kavita. When I started, with my limited knowledge of the scene or what Kavita would grow to become, I implemented people as tags, much like how ComicInfo does. This is constrained when you want to make people more entity-focused, like having a dedicated page for them. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this release, you can now view individual details of a person, set a cover and description about the person and see their works and individual issues they worked on. You can also browse authors and artists, like other software has. This is just the start, please leave feedback for me via Feature Requests, so I can build this feature out more and make it a richer experience. \u003Cstrong\u003ENote: Any Smart Filters that relied on people will need manual intervention to correct. A force scan will be required to regenerate writer information.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/992c5451-08c3-45c5-81ce-4426967d3127\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\r\n\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1a06eb8-ddde-44f6-98c2-98315b252494\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ESpecial Keyword Removal\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last thing with the scanner was removing Kavita\u0027s ability to detect and classify certain keywords as Special. Like \u003Ccode\u003EOmake\u003C/code\u003E  or \u003Ccode\u003EAnnual\u003C/code\u003E would classify a file as a special. While this is extremely handy in the Manga scene, there were numerous reports over the years that required manual workarounds by users. In order to behave more reliably, I opened a discussion this year for removal and made the final call. \u003Cstrong\u003ESpecials going forward will need the SP marker on the filename (or tagged internally).\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ECoversDB\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita has had the ability to download and display favicon and publisher images with a fallback repository being hosted on the main Kavita website. In this release, I\u0027ve moved all that functionality and those images over to a new CoversDB \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/CoversDB\u0022\u003Erepo\u003C/a\u003E. This repo will be the home for anything related to pulling images for Kavita instances. I plan to enhance this further as new features come to Kavita.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ESmall QoL Features\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ELast Read Filter\u003C/strong\u003E is a new feature that allows you to pass a number that will be subtracted from TODAY, upping the dynamic function and allowing users to build Smart Filters like \u0026quot;Haven\u0027t read in a month\u0026quot;. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EColorscape Polish\u003C/strong\u003E The colorscape system has been polished even further. I spent a good amount of time adding some randomness, fixed a bug with colorscape resetting between navigation, and tried to tweak where colors go to avoid harsh contrasts. It\u0027s not perfect, but it\u0027s a step in the right direction. If you\u0027re passionate about the colorscape system, I welcome collaboration. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EBulk Library Actions\u003C/strong\u003E This is something @DieselTech has been pushing me to add and the time is finally here. For users that have a lot of libraries (like Diesel and his 200\u002B), sometimes it\u0027s quite a pain to update the settings of them all or perform some actions. Now in Kavita there are some limited bulk options, like refreshing covers or copying settings from one library to another (Scan currently disabled). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2517e6f1-4548-4d30-ae23-17dc80688771\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ERecap\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release has been a ton of work on my part, but I felt it was important to squash the bugs first and ensure Kavita remains stable while I continue to add more features and bring a richer experience to users. My next release is still aimed at finishing the UX Overhaul with attention on Kavita\u002B. With the holidays coming up, it is expected that this will take longer than most releases. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those that have seen, we have hit over 65K active installs. It\u0027s absolutely amazing that a small project I started due to Ubooquity not having metadata has turned into such a massive project with a huge userbase. I want to give my thanks again to those in the community that have raised bugs, feature requests, give support in the discord/reddit, those who give me donations via OC/Kavita\u002B, the translators, and of course my wife that helps support me pouring so much time into the project. \u003Cstrong\u003EI\u0027m excited to continue building Kavita and bring about more of our visions into the software and see what is possible.\u003C/strong\u003E \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPeople metadata will be removed on update. A force scan is required to repopulate in the new system. A force scan/first scan will be much slower than before.\u003C/h3\u003E\n"

    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s finally here, the UX Refresh. Robbie and I have been dreaming and planning this for over a year now and we\u0027ve grinded for 2 months (with my trip to Norway/Finland between) to bring it to you. The feedback from the nightly testers has been fantastic! Everyone is in love. We have poured over the UX, both on mobile and on desktop, to bring what we think is a consistent and killer experience. We took a lot of inspiration from Plex and if anyone knows, I\u0027m trying to make Kavita the Plex for reading. So let\u0027s get into the nitty gritty of what makes this release. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EColorscape\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I browse Plex, I\u0027m always blown away by the accent colors on movie detail pages. Contrast that to Kavita, I felt it was sorely lacking. So I brought it to Kavita and let me tell you, it was no easy feat. Hours wasted on css gradients before realizing the complex system Plex has. Kavita now will show a nice gradient in the background of any page that has a cover (except reading lists and collections, these will likely follow in the future). What\u0027s even cooler is the system is able to be turned on/off with a custom theme or even customized by theme creators. This is the feature I\u0027m most proud of with this release. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25b81beb-1333-4e82-b22f-8f41e3c9c72d\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EIndividual Pages\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a big thing for Book and Comic users, the ability to view individual volume/chapter metadata. This not only brings dedicated pages (and the ability to update metadata for individual chapters/books), but also the ability to read a series/chapter/volume from any card. No longer do you need to open the series detail page. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/954050d9-184e-46b6-8cbf-1985844aef8d\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ESettings Overhaul\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain taking inspiration from Plex, we updated the settings pages to bring tooltip information front and center and make changes to any field instant (no more pressing save).  All settings, from admin to user preferences, are now on one screen. Some flows have been moved to dedicated pages, like CBL Import or MAL Interest Stack import. This should help with bringing visibility to some of the features Kavita has. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa330cb2-ae1b-442a-a109-3c568104e8e8\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPublisher Images\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, we added a new system similar to favicons for publisher images. This new system allows for users to submit or edit publisher images on our \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/kareadita.github.io?tab=readme-ov-file#publishers\u0022\u003Ekavita repo\u003C/a\u003E and these images will be downloaded dynamically and displayed on the detail pages. Some images may not look good. I am counting on the community to add new or edit images to bring the best UX to all users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21791599-0956-49fb-b817-f3117e4defba\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I\u0027m really proud of this release. Next up is an overhaul to the UX surrounding Kavita\u002B including reworking some of the systems and laying more foundation for future feature releases. I am also working on building out the test cases for the Scanner to allow me to continue working on the elusive Foreign Key constraint issue still plaguing us and working on bringing more optimizations into the Scan Loop to make Kavita faster. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I want to make a big thank you to those that contribute on Weblate. This release was massive and many localization strings were changed. The localizers were on top of it and as of this release, we are shipping Kavita in 10 languages with full support. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERefresh your browser after updating\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added ability to upload a volume cover for Komf users\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a lot of ability to theme the login screen, including the background image.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added ColorScapes. ColorScapes is a new dynamic tinting system for Kavita. During cover generation, Kavita will pick primary colors from the image and apply them to the background on pages where the image is a primary element (series detail for now). These are configurable via the theming system. (Light themes do not look good with this system, it should be disabled)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a new actionable for Library to generate colorscapes (which is a soft refresh covers)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Library Settings and Edit Series Modal now has a tasks tab that shows appropriate tasks that can be done on the library/series along with information about what the task does.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a Volume/Chapter detail page.

Komf has already updated with support. (Thanks @Snd-R)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added the ability to have publisher images (that are managed on Kavita\u0027s site, like favicons).

    "BlogPart": "\u003Cp\u003EIt\u0027s finally here, the UX Refresh. Robbie and I have been dreaming and planning this for over a year now and we\u0027ve grinded for 2 months (with my trip to Norway/Finland between) to bring it to you. The feedback from the nightly testers has been fantastic! Everyone is in love. We have poured over the UX, both on mobile and on desktop, to bring what we think is a consistent and killer experience. We took a lot of inspiration from Plex and if anyone knows, I\u0027m trying to make Kavita the Plex for reading. So let\u0027s get into the nitty gritty of what makes this release. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EColorscape\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhen I browse Plex, I\u0027m always blown away by the accent colors on movie detail pages. Contrast that to Kavita, I felt it was sorely lacking. So I brought it to Kavita and let me tell you, it was no easy feat. Hours wasted on css gradients before realizing the complex system Plex has. Kavita now will show a nice gradient in the background of any page that has a cover (except reading lists and collections, these will likely follow in the future). What\u0027s even cooler is the system is able to be turned on/off with a custom theme or even customized by theme creators. This is the feature I\u0027m most proud of with this release. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25b81beb-1333-4e82-b22f-8f41e3c9c72d\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EIndividual Pages\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a big thing for Book and Comic users, the ability to view individual volume/chapter metadata. This not only brings dedicated pages (and the ability to update metadata for individual chapters/books), but also the ability to read a series/chapter/volume from any card. No longer do you need to open the series detail page. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/954050d9-184e-46b6-8cbf-1985844aef8d\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ESettings Overhaul\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAgain taking inspiration from Plex, we updated the settings pages to bring tooltip information front and center and make changes to any field instant (no more pressing save).  All settings, from admin to user preferences, are now on one screen. Some flows have been moved to dedicated pages, like CBL Import or MAL Interest Stack import. This should help with bringing visibility to some of the features Kavita has. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa330cb2-ae1b-442a-a109-3c568104e8e8\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EPublisher Images\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, we added a new system similar to favicons for publisher images. This new system allows for users to submit or edit publisher images on our \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/kareadita.github.io?tab=readme-ov-file#publishers\u0022\u003Ekavita repo\u003C/a\u003E and these images will be downloaded dynamically and displayed on the detail pages. Some images may not look good. I am counting on the community to add new or edit images to bring the best UX to all users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21791599-0956-49fb-b817-f3117e4defba\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAll in all, I\u0027m really proud of this release. Next up is an overhaul to the UX surrounding Kavita\u002B including reworking some of the systems and laying more foundation for future feature releases. I am also working on building out the test cases for the Scanner to allow me to continue working on the elusive Foreign Key constraint issue still plaguing us and working on bringing more optimizations into the Scan Loop to make Kavita faster. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I want to make a big thank you to those that contribute on Weblate. This release was massive and many localization strings were changed. The localizers were on top of it and as of this release, we are shipping Kavita in 10 languages with full support. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ERefresh your browser after updating\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n"

It\u0027s not easy when the admin has to add the theme for you and hit scan, dealing with the underlying filesystem. I finally got around to setting up the initial version of this (open to feedback to expand on this system) with v0.8.2. All users will have the ability to browse themes uploaded to the theme repo, preview the images and description, and download and apply theme. This currently does not have any role permission and I didn\u0027t hear much from nightly users thinking it\u0027s needed. If you feel otherwise, raise a discussion. If you don\u0027t want to use a theme on the repo, you can upload your own file via the interface. Existing theme users should delete their themes and re-acquire them. This will allow them to be updated for you automatically (assuming the supported version matches yours). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/assets/735851/b40e1284-8c30-4f3b-968c-73227abb65f3\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ESmart Collections for Kavita\u002B\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is another one I\u0027ve wanted for a while and is part of the theme of introducing more synchronization systems into Kavita. Smart Collections allow for you to import any Interest Stacks/Restacks from your MAL account into Kavita. Every 2 days, Kavita will resync with upstream and add any Series that you own to the collection. The collection is otherwise read-only and promotable, so if you want to setup a few best of X and promote them for your server, you can. These features are also not admin-specific. Any user can import their interest stacks into the server (and if they have the promotion role, can promote them). I hope you all enjoy this feature as much as I am. Another level of bringing a top notch experience for my users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EScanner Changes\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working a lot with our users that have larger libraries, ranging from 100k files to 10k series. One of the major problems is that when you have a library of 10k, it\u0027s going to take a long time as expected. These users are mainly new users coming from the comic rework and have folder structures Kavita wasn\u0027t originally built around. I spent a good chunk of time building optimizations to reduce the amount of processing work Kavita does for these folder layouts (not restrictive to comic libraries) and fixing some bugs around parsing and whatnot that surfaced thanks to the numerous bug reports. If you aren\u0027t finding good results after this update, please do reach out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMisc Changes\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA few other big changes come with this release. The first is WAL is now on by default. You can always turn this off manually in the DB, but fresh installs (and existing) will turn WAL on. WAL fixes the common \u003Ccode\u003Edatabase is locked\u003C/code\u003E issue due to Kavita writing too much data too fast. Another big one is double scrollbar on mobile. This was an annoying bug on some mobile browsers on some pages. Robbie took this up and fixed it everywhere to my knowledge. A great QoL enhancement. OPDS has gotten a lot of love in this release thanks to some great reports by @MnsieurJF around reading lists and missing metadata in the feeds. Lastly, the Manga Reader has had some tweaking to how fit to height/width works. It\u0027s not easy to put into words, but I find the fitting to be MUCH better. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have loose plans for what the next release is going to be. The PDF rework will need to come after v0.8.3 to allow people who upgrade into the v0.8.x series not to loose data from the massive changes. I have a lot of holiday coming up as well, so the release may be longer or shorter depending. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I want to mention (as I keep forgetting) that @DieselTech has joined the Kavita team a few months ago. His name should be well known as he\u0027s very active in most of the reading and comic discords as well as being a core member in the CBL Reading Order group. He\u0027s already driven a lot of great changes in Kavita for hardcore comic users and I have no doubt he will continue to be a great resource for me to rely on in the future. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Kavita\u002B users can now import their MAL interest stacks/restacks into Kavita as Smart Collections. These collections will synchronize back with MAL to update with new series and summary information every 2 days. Smart Collections work just as normal collections except are non-editable as the MAL stack controls the data. They can be promoted given the user has promotion role. They are not admin-specific. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added the ability for any user to download themes from the Theme Repo directly via Kavita. Kavita will keep these themes up to data automatically (unless the reported version from the Repo is greater than the server version).\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Book series can now have specials. In order to be classified as a Special, the SP marker must be in the filename, the calibre:series must be set to the Series name and \u003Ccode\u003Ecalibre:series_index\u003C/code\u003E must be 0. (Feature Request: 3 upvotes)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: OPDS-PS on PDF files is now possible. Kavita will convert to images.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a create link to create a new smart filter in case it\u0027s not clear for first time users exploring the software.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added first install version and date to the DB so admin\u0027s can look back at it. This data is available in System tab.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added new Random sort option to allow a stream like \u0027Top Unread in X\u0027 (Thanks @Fesaa)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added the following css variables --event-widget-activity-bg-color, --event-widget-update-bg-color, --event-widget-error-bg-color\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Implemented the ability to click download on any file extension from stats page (formats table) and download a report of all files that are of that extension.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added the ability to manually override the width in the manga/webtoon reader when using Width scaling (Thanks @Marsimplodation) (Feature Request: 19 upvotes)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added bulk promote/demote/delete for reading lists to align with collections.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EChanged\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: On forgot password, even if email isn\u0027t setup or user doesn\u0027t have email setup, still allow the reset link to log. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Reduced memory for adding a set of series to a collection.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Scan button no longer exists on themes tab. Now, admin\u0027s can upload their custom css files via the UI.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Admin\u0027s can no longer delete themes and force users with that theme active off.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Changed how scaling works in the manga reader to be more inline with the expected behavior. Height will scale to viewport height even if it is beyond the image\u0027s original dimensions. Width will scale to viewport width even if it is beyond the image\u0027s original dimensions. Original will show the image at its intrinsic dimensions, no scaling is applied (Thanks @therobbiedavis)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Enable WAL journal mode by default in all Kavita installs. Users can turn it off after the first run if needed.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Show a warning on dirty email setting form to inform the user they need to save before testing settings.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Ensure users know that Scrobbling providers will always keep the highest number from kavita.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: On \u0026lt; tablet viewports, reading list page should use order numbers rather than drag and drop, as there isn\u0027t enough real estate.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Series Detail page will now show people/genre/tags as collapsed even on desktop, but summary will have same code to be expanded up to 1000 characters on desktop.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Scanner) Refactored Scan Loop to avoid doing extra work on lower folders in a folder map path, so that users that group by publisher or another arbitrary folder, can avoid a lot of scanning on lower level folders just because the highest level changed.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Performance) Applied some performance optimizations on Series OPDS route which should help speed up heavier Series.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Performance) Small optimization to image reader to make finding the next/prev page faster.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Search will no longer search against Chapter titles and Files by default. Instead, there is a new link in the search window to perform with those included. This should help users with larger libraries find their files faster.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Kavita\u002B) Kavita\u002B scrobbling will now take AniList/Mal ids from External metadata (which is prefetched from Kavita\u002B for the external metadata) whenever possible. This can help with matching when there are no weblinks.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Updates dependencies which includes a fix for nav items in epub toc that are more loose. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Added a few full-wdith characters for normalization: \uFF0A\uFF01\uFF0B\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: All smart filters page now uses the same design as the flow from Customize modal.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Disable the first remove button for weblinks/exclude pattern component as it isn\u0027t removable\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Updated ScanFolder to be more aggressive in finding the underlying series by also checking against a partial match on lowest folder path to find a series. This should result in less work for well structured libraries.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Performance) Cleaned up some extra db calls that aren\u0027t needed in the OPDS apis.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Reading Lists in both OPDS/UI now have the underlying issue\u0027s summary.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Smart Filter OPDS feeds are now smart-filters/{id} instead of smart-filter/{id}\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Updated the cover generation logic to handle webtoons better. The new code will now check if the image scales well or not and if not, use a more attention focused scaling/cropping method. (Thanks @arition for the \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/pull/2612\u0022\u003Einitial PR\u003C/a\u003E)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: For OPDS Reading Lists, when there is only one underlying file (common), send an acquisition link rather than a subsection. This allows the removal of one of the clicks for nearly all users. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: When a scan is enqueued or in progress, have the scanner aware and reschedule tasks mins into the future (except scan series which is 1 min)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Added more logging into scanner service and ensure folder watching isn\u0027t over triggering the scan loop.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Redesigned the loading indicators on the events widget to be cleaner and more expressive. Added the online user count to the nav bar like Plex has. Added an update icon like error/info to help users know when there are updates.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Performance) Converted series detail to control flow syntax to hopefully speed up change detection when there is a large amount of chapters.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Performance) Don\u0027t render all tabs by default on series detail. When switching tabs, it will destroy the DOM. This helps a lot with change detection on first load and later changes. First load on big series can take over 30 seconds to process. This means you will incur the long load when activating the tab with a lot of cards.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Tweaked how jobs are queued and what messages we send to the UI. First, Scan tasks invoked via the UI will now send reschedule alerts when a scan is in progress and another is about to be kicked off. Scan Series now will retry 200 times instead of 3 given new rescheduling code.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EFixed\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug where Hangfire could be accessible when it wasn\u0027t supposed to.

This caused out of order reading in Mihon (Thanks @SamuelBMartins)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed an issue where one some screens images would stack instead of being side by side while using the double setting in the manga reader. (Thanks @therobbiedavis)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed an issue where the cover and last page would not be positioned correctly when using the double (Manga) setting in the manga reader. (Thanks @therobbiedavis)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed the issue with review cards provider and score extending outside it\u0027s card boundary. (Thanks @therobbiedavis)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed an issue with double scrollbar when viewing saved smart filters (Thanks @therobbiedavis)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed up the info icon cards on series detail to be better with responsiveness on some breakpoints.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed an issue where one-shot/specials in Scrobble History would show internal encoding\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug with Image series where caching the images for reading could create a ton of folders with the same files inside. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Word count analysis will now handle missing manifest items gracefully and report media errors around said file.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed bcmap files not loading in the pdf reader \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug when adding items to a reading list in bulk, sorting order of those chapters was not being respected.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug when a file of Chapter 0.2 first scanned in, Kavita would render the card as \u0027Chapter 0.2 - .2\u0027 then on another scan, Kavita would correctly render out \u0027Chapter 0.2\u0027.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Loading indicator wasn\u0027t properly wired up in the search component \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed an edge case bug when performing a series scan, it wouldn\u0027t respect the exclude patterns of the library.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a case where specials in the manga reader weren\u0027t giving the special name \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a case where there could be no storyline chapters but just normal chapters and OPDS feed wouldn\u0027t render correctly. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a case where content type could fail, for example with avif. Now a failsafe is in place.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed some OPDS feeds where author (writer) wasn\u0027t being sent. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a parser case where a file was marked as special but also had an issue number, the issue number would un-specialize it. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Added a migration to nullify LowestFolderPaths that did not start with a library root. This was caused by an old bug likely that has hence been fixed, yet old records break the new scan loop.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug where LowestSeriesFolder was not a full rooted path on linux\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed an issue where metadata apis could return genres/tags/people coming from libraries a user doesn\u0027t have access to.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug with publication status when there is a set number of volumes but that series also has a special in it.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug where OPDS urls could have api/opds//api/opds instead of just api/opds/\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed up the code in the system tab where users may be on a revision of 0 but the Github release doesn\u0027t have a revision, causing the page to always show as nightly, even though it\u0027s a stable. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixes the pdf search button not displaying (Thanks @Zackaree)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed double scrollbar \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug where continue from title was not taking library type into consideration nor was localized\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Cleaned up the event widget showing nothing going on here when it shouldn\u0027t. Fixed a missing localization.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug where some events weren\u0027t sending their name and event widget wasn\u0027t clearing them after opening their detail modal.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a case where when mass deleting series from library detail page, the page could refresh a lot more than needed.

      "Tweaked how jobs are queued and what messages we send to the UI. First, Scan tasks invoked via the UI will now send reschedule alerts when a scan is in progress and another is about to be kicked off. Scan Series now will retry 200 times instead of 3 given new rescheduling code."

    "BlogPart": "\u003Cp\u003EA new stable release is here and it is yet again another big one. Initially I set out to focus on 3 items: Scanner, Smart Collections, and CBL v2 (new schema), but here I am delivering 3 massive improvements and a ton of smaller changes. This release includes a bit of everything spread about. Let\u0027s get into it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EBuilt-in Theme Explorer\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne thing I wanted since day one of adding theme support into Kavita was the ability for users you just browse a list of themes and download what they want to use. It\u0027s not easy when the admin has to add the theme for you and hit scan, dealing with the underlying filesystem. I finally got around to setting up the initial version of this (open to feedback to expand on this system) with v0.8.2. All users will have the ability to browse themes uploaded to the theme repo, preview the images and description, and download and apply theme. This currently does not have any role permission and I didn\u0027t hear much from nightly users thinking it\u0027s needed. If you feel otherwise, raise a discussion. If you don\u0027t want to use a theme on the repo, you can upload your own file via the interface. Existing theme users should delete their themes and re-acquire them. This will allow them to be updated for you automatically (assuming the supported version matches yours). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/assets/735851/b40e1284-8c30-4f3b-968c-73227abb65f3\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ESmart Collections for Kavita\u002B\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is another one I\u0027ve wanted for a while and is part of the theme of introducing more synchronization systems into Kavita. Smart Collections allow for you to import any Interest Stacks/Restacks from your MAL account into Kavita. Every 2 days, Kavita will resync with upstream and add any Series that you own to the collection. The collection is otherwise read-only and promotable, so if you want to setup a few best of X and promote them for your server, you can. These features are also not admin-specific. Any user can import their interest stacks into the server (and if they have the promotion role, can promote them). I hope you all enjoy this feature as much as I am. Another level of bringing a top notch experience for my users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EScanner Changes\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027ve been working a lot with our users that have larger libraries, ranging from 100k files to 10k series. One of the major problems is that when you have a library of 10k, it\u0027s going to take a long time as expected. These users are mainly new users coming from the comic rework and have folder structures Kavita wasn\u0027t originally built around. I spent a good chunk of time building optimizations to reduce the amount of processing work Kavita does for these folder layouts (not restrictive to comic libraries) and fixing some bugs around parsing and whatnot that surfaced thanks to the numerous bug reports. If you aren\u0027t finding good results after this update, please do reach out.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMisc Changes\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA few other big changes come with this release. The first is WAL is now on by default. You can always turn this off manually in the DB, but fresh installs (and existing) will turn WAL on. WAL fixes the common \u003Ccode\u003Edatabase is locked\u003C/code\u003E issue due to Kavita writing too much data too fast. Another big one is double scrollbar on mobile. This was an annoying bug on some mobile browsers on some pages. Robbie took this up and fixed it everywhere to my knowledge. A great QoL enhancement. OPDS has gotten a lot of love in this release thanks to some great reports by @MnsieurJF around reading lists and missing metadata in the feeds. Lastly, the Manga Reader has had some tweaking to how fit to height/width works. It\u0027s not easy to put into words, but I find the fitting to be MUCH better. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have loose plans for what the next release is going to be. The PDF rework will need to come after v0.8.3 to allow people who upgrade into the v0.8.x series not to loose data from the massive changes. I have a lot of holiday coming up as well, so the release may be longer or shorter depending. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I want to mention (as I keep forgetting) that @DieselTech has joined the Kavita team a few months ago. His name should be well known as he\u0027s very active in most of the reading and comic discords as well as being a core member in the CBL Reading Order group. He\u0027s already driven a lot of great changes in Kavita for hardcore comic users and I have no doubt he will continue to be a great resource for me to rely on in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n"

    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever thought to yourself that you\u0027d like to switch the foundation of your house from slab to pier and beam? Well, that\u0027s essentially what I\u0027ve done with this release, and not only that, I had to do it without a single picture falling off the walls. This release comprises a whopping 48K lines of code added and 5.5K removed throughout 400 files.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order for me to achieve my vision of Kavita being the best software out there for reading, sometimes sacrifices have to be made. When I started building Kavita, I had never thought of what it would be today nor the part it would take in my life. It was simply a tool for me to consume and collect Manga since Ubooquity didn\u0027t have support for rich metadata. As users came along, so did the scope. Some features were added with limited knowledge, like comics, and that lack of knowledge in the beginning became a problem for heavy comic collectors. In order to build towards my vision of being the best, I had to rewrite large portions of how Kavita functions, work closely with the community, and deliver the best product I could. I want to first and foremost thank @DieselTech, who has been a key component in this. He has been pushing me relentlessly over the past year and has had a major hand in shaping the features, working with hardcore collectors from other servers (Mylar, Komga, and the CBL initiative).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s get into the meat and potatoes. What is new in this release?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EComic Overhaul\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to support these hardcore users, Kavita needs to align with the tools already in the space, primarily Mylar and CBL. Mylar serves as the collection tool, aligning with Comic Vine for standards of naming and tagging, while CBL provides a rich repository of reading lists to make navigating comics easier. One of the most important differences between the old \u0027Comic\u0027 library and the new \u0027Comic Vine\u0027 library is that the Volume number is always the year and is used in the generation of the Series title. The new library type is strictly for those who abide by the rules laid out by Comic Vine and CBL. CBL works around these assumptions for linking up issues from many series into one reading list.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s not all. Comics are unique; they can have Issue \u03A9, which should be between Issues 8 and 9, or how about issue 18.HU? These are unique situations that didn\u0027t particularly go well with Kavita\u0027s number-based system. Through a feat of engineering, Kavita can now support these situations and, not only that, will soon allow the admins to actually change the sort order, a feature which, to my knowledge, no other software supports. This also means that Issue 0 (which can happen in Manga too) is now supported.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the massive amount of testing, users have reported that this new library meets their needs perfectly. There are other small things, like Annual Series relationships, updates to CBL Import flows, etc., but the major points are above. This feature took 30K lines of code and 3 weeks of development for me to deliver to the testers (plus 2 weeks more of testing).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ECollection Overhaul\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile we are on the topic of reworking major code, let\u0027s talk about collections. When I first coded these, I made a really bad call and tied them with Series (so a series belongs to a collection), but as I started working on new collection-related features, I realized how bad of a call this was. I needed collections to be user-based, like want-to-read or reading lists. While this isn\u0027t really needed now, it will be with a future update.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, yet again, I had to plan on how to migrate user data to the new collections without data loss and rework a ton of code. These new collections are user-based, and through a new Role, non-admins can even promote their own collections and share them with the server. While I was in there, I also made bulk promote/demote easier. Another easy 5K lines of code added and just over 1K removed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMisc\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the large, foundational features are over, and we can talk about some of the smaller things, like finally adding PDF settings a year after adding a PDF reader. Yikes. That\u0027s right, I finally got around to it and added PDF settings, along with also adding tap-to-paginate to the PDF reader.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother area that has been receiving attention is Themes. Kavita saw an influx of new themes recently (and a few bug fixes too). Quite a few users are using these themes, and they look pretty good. Check them out on our Theme Repo. It\u0027s really easy to build your own, so if you have an interest, I highly encourage you to give it a go.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you might have noticed is Kavita\u002B enhancements. Quite a few small things were updated, but the most important is that Kavita\u002B will now auto-fetch data when you add new series and slowly work in the background to fetch external metadata. I have more planned around reporting on the data and managing bad matches against Kavita\u002B, especially as I am still planning on basic metadata fetching, but I have found that this drastically improves load times on new series and makes the experience much better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I mentioned this last release, but Diesel has been hard at work on a complete revamp of the wiki. As of v0.8, we have moved over to the new wiki. Older installs wiki links will no longer work. Thanks again to @DieselTech for yet another monumental add to Kavita. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EImportant\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportant!\u003C/strong\u003E Once you update to this release there are manually steps needed! You MUST perform a forced library scan on all libraries to migrate properly to the new foundation. Failure to do so may result in data loss. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a massive update, all progress data will be exported on the first run to config/progress_export.csv. The migrations may take up to 10 minutes to migrate. Do not stop midway, you will break your db and need to restore from a backup. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita\u002B users: As mentioned last release, you are expected to stay up to date - 2 releases. Old Kavita\u002B APIs will be shutdown shortly after v0.8. You can update to v0.7.14 as the minimum.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe default emailer was supposed to be turned off last release. I held it longer to give time.

This will use card list layout by default (overriding user preferences) and is eligible for Kavita\u002B metadata/scrobbling. The regular book library no longer is Kavita\u002B eligible.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a label on Library settings modal to help admins know which libraries are eligible for Kavita\u002B scrobbling/metadata pull.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) Implemented a background prefetch task that will slowly refresh series from Kavita\u002B (reviews, recs, ratings).\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) Kavita will now prefetch data from Kavita\u002B on new series.

Loading on-demand will still work as normal and is not restricted.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Chapters now sort by SortOrder. SortOrder is generated from chapter number, but can be overridden (in a future update). This allows for custom sorting for issues that aren\u0027t purely numerical. SortOrder will handle cases like 19, 19.HU, 19.BD, 20 without any user intervention.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: You can now have Chapter 0, -1, etc.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: This fully supports chapters with non-numeric issue numbers, like Alpha, 19.HU, etc.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a new library type: Comic Vine which is aimed at users of Mylar or have well tagged libraries following Comic Vine. This library works different and can support multiple folders with the same series parallel to library root.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: New Series Relationship of Annual.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Imprints are now read from ComicInfo, will display on the UI and can be filtered.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Scanner) Added a new LowestFolderPath.

This pairs well with the background job that fills out your server over time. (This will be expanded upon in a future update)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Parser) Added parser support for Thai language volume and chapters (Thanks @gozilla-paradise)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Finally added PDF Reader Settings\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (PDF Reader) Added tap to paginate to the pdf reader.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Collections can now be created by non-admins\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Collections can now be promoted by non-admins (given they have the Promote role).\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added bulk flows for Promotion and Deletion. If you select cards that are not owned by you, nothing will happen to those cards.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: OPDS feeds will now send description information when applicable for underlying volume/chapters.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EChanged\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Kavita\u002B) Removed Book library from Scrobbling/Metadata pull. Books being in Google Books was far and few in-between. This is a temporary solution until Hardcover support is implemented, which has good Book (and some Comic) support. If you have light novels, change to the LN library type. The scanner works the same.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Allow users to send files to their devices without having host name set for Email settings\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Theme) side-nav-color is now side-nav-text-color\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Theme) Added carousel-btn-color (for carousel buttons) and badge-text-color (for badge text)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: When iOS users are trying to download files greater than 200MB, they will be given an additional warning that iOS may fail to download due to arbitrary limits each device has.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Specials will now order by SP marker numbers, else fallback to natural sort\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Loose Leaf volumes are now encoded with the number -100000 instead of 0. This now means users can have a Volume 0 without issue.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Search will now search against a chapter range and will also fallback if there is no title (comicinfo title) to the range.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Clean up a log message when no files found, to ensure the admin checks the Library settings as well.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Image Library is now more aligned to reported usage\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Changed chapter title format to Chapter {number} - {title} (assuming title exists), else Chapter {number}.

Nothing major, will do the overhaul later.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Trim strings from ComicInfo more aggressively to prevent weird parsing for things like Number.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Optimized a lot of the scanner and cleaned up the code deeply.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Parser) Adjusted the special parsing for Annuals to account for \u0027Series Annual \\d\u0027\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Dependency and security updates\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Added a flag to the CBL import to use Comic Vine parsing for CBL Import (and set to true as all CBLs to my knowledge are using this new library).\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Kavita now handles non-float numbers from CBL Imports (including special cases for comics)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Kavita\u002B) During library setting modal, changing type will now automatically change the Allow Scrobbling control, if the underlying library type is not Kavita\u002B applicable.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Normalize all paths during the scanner to ensure everything is always the same.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Added the csv files to the backup as those are used in manual migrations and likely good to have.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Kavita\u002B) When a rate limit error comes in after the pre-check, retry after the wait window instead of waiting for the next scrobble window.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Some epubs have incorrect metadata where the series is parsing with a volume. To help users, Kavita will override this on Light Novel library type to merge into the correct series.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Added a bit of a loader when deleting a lot of series with bulk actions.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Tweaked some wording about the changelog component to better indicate to nightly users that are not on the latest stable-based nightlies.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: When using Force Scan on library settings, automatically close the modal.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Scanner) Change pdf parser so if it\u0027s a library type book, we override chapters as chapter number is RARELY used and mainly results in false positives.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Scanner) Fixed up the parsing so that book parser will coerced when the series in the metadata is wrong but there is a volume tag in said series, it will override.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Added a fallback to the series detail page to handle bad pdf parses (until the upcoming pdf parser rewrite comes) to avoid no cards showing.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Turned down the amount of debug logging from the library watcher and moved them to trace.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Added some code so that while the device is offline, the UI wont try to refresh JWT and likewise, when turned back online, a JWT Refresh will be called to hopefully extend the session. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Collections will show who created them under the card.

    "BlogPart": "\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever thought to yourself that you\u0027d like to switch the foundation of your house from slab to pier and beam? Well, that\u0027s essentially what I\u0027ve done with this release, and not only that, I had to do it without a single picture falling off the walls. This release comprises a whopping 48K lines of code added and 5.5K removed throughout 400 files.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order for me to achieve my vision of Kavita being the best software out there for reading, sometimes sacrifices have to be made. When I started building Kavita, I had never thought of what it would be today nor the part it would take in my life. It was simply a tool for me to consume and collect Manga since Ubooquity didn\u0027t have support for rich metadata. As users came along, so did the scope. Some features were added with limited knowledge, like comics, and that lack of knowledge in the beginning became a problem for heavy comic collectors. In order to build towards my vision of being the best, I had to rewrite large portions of how Kavita functions, work closely with the community, and deliver the best product I could. I want to first and foremost thank @DieselTech, who has been a key component in this. He has been pushing me relentlessly over the past year and has had a major hand in shaping the features, working with hardcore collectors from other servers (Mylar, Komga, and the CBL initiative).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENow, let\u0027s get into the meat and potatoes. What is new in this release?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EComic Overhaul\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn order to support these hardcore users, Kavita needs to align with the tools already in the space, primarily Mylar and CBL. Mylar serves as the collection tool, aligning with Comic Vine for standards of naming and tagging, while CBL provides a rich repository of reading lists to make navigating comics easier. One of the most important differences between the old \u0027Comic\u0027 library and the new \u0027Comic Vine\u0027 library is that the Volume number is always the year and is used in the generation of the Series title. The new library type is strictly for those who abide by the rules laid out by Comic Vine and CBL. CBL works around these assumptions for linking up issues from many series into one reading list.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that\u0027s not all. Comics are unique; they can have Issue \u03A9, which should be between Issues 8 and 9, or how about issue 18.HU? These are unique situations that didn\u0027t particularly go well with Kavita\u0027s number-based system. Through a feat of engineering, Kavita can now support these situations and, not only that, will soon allow the admins to actually change the sort order, a feature which, to my knowledge, no other software supports. This also means that Issue 0 (which can happen in Manga too) is now supported.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom the massive amount of testing, users have reported that this new library meets their needs perfectly. There are other small things, like Annual Series relationships, updates to CBL Import flows, etc., but the major points are above. This feature took 30K lines of code and 3 weeks of development for me to deliver to the testers (plus 2 weeks more of testing).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ECollection Overhaul\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhile we are on the topic of reworking major code, let\u0027s talk about collections. When I first coded these, I made a really bad call and tied them with Series (so a series belongs to a collection), but as I started working on new collection-related features, I realized how bad of a call this was. I needed collections to be user-based, like want-to-read or reading lists. While this isn\u0027t really needed now, it will be with a future update.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo, yet again, I had to plan on how to migrate user data to the new collections without data loss and rework a ton of code. These new collections are user-based, and through a new Role, non-admins can even promote their own collections and share them with the server. While I was in there, I also made bulk promote/demote easier. Another easy 5K lines of code added and just over 1K removed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EMisc\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, the large, foundational features are over, and we can talk about some of the smaller things, like finally adding PDF settings a year after adding a PDF reader. Yikes. That\u0027s right, I finally got around to it and added PDF settings, along with also adding tap-to-paginate to the PDF reader.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother area that has been receiving attention is Themes. Kavita saw an influx of new themes recently (and a few bug fixes too). Quite a few users are using these themes, and they look pretty good. Check them out on our Theme Repo. It\u0027s really easy to build your own, so if you have an interest, I highly encourage you to give it a go.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother thing you might have noticed is Kavita\u002B enhancements. Quite a few small things were updated, but the most important is that Kavita\u002B will now auto-fetch data when you add new series and slowly work in the background to fetch external metadata. I have more planned around reporting on the data and managing bad matches against Kavita\u002B, especially as I am still planning on basic metadata fetching, but I have found that this drastically improves load times on new series and makes the experience much better.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, I mentioned this last release, but Diesel has been hard at work on a complete revamp of the wiki. As of v0.8, we have moved over to the new wiki. Older installs wiki links will no longer work. Thanks again to @DieselTech for yet another monumental add to Kavita. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EImportant\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EImportant!\u003C/strong\u003E Once you update to this release there are manually steps needed! You MUST perform a forced library scan on all libraries to migrate properly to the new foundation. Failure to do so may result in data loss. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is a massive update, all progress data will be exported on the first run to config/progress_export.csv. The migrations may take up to 10 minutes to migrate. Do not stop midway, you will break your db and need to restore from a backup. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita\u002B users: As mentioned last release, you are expected to stay up to date - 2 releases.

    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003EA small on the surface, large under the hood release for everyone. This release first off fixes the webtoon reader for our iOS users. Many have validated and want to thank the community for helping me test and @thundernerd for doing some basic POC to help me drive it home. In addition to this, Want to Read had a critical bug in the architecture (that somehow slipped noticed for over a year now) where if one user adds a series to want to read, then another does, it will override the other. And lastly, for Kavita\u002B users, this is foundational release for the upcoming Basic Metadata feature. All data, like reviews, recommendations, and ratings are now stored in your DB. This leads to very quick response times and sets up the system for future data synchronization. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother big feature in this release is KavitaEmail is no longer required for those that want to use email (and me hosting an email service for everyone is no more). All email settings are built into the application and this has allowed me to streamline how Kavita works around email. Before, it was a mess of having to call an external system, check if the system was accessible externally, etc. Now, you MUST setup a host name (reverse proxy domain) and the email settings to use any email functionality. Due to this, all the flows got polished and should be much more consistent for users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, while it looks so small, it was over 3K lines of code, but volume numbers are now float-based, meaning if a volume is \u0026lt; 1, it will now properly show on book library series detail page. In addition to this, Omnibus (Volume 1-2) is now much better supported and Kavita\u002B will get Volume 2 when you read an Omnibus vs Volume 1 previously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat wraps the v0.7.x series of releases. Next release series (v0.8.x) will be focusing mainly on the new Magazine library type, PDF parsing enhancements, and likely the new comic library.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ENew Wiki\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly I want to call out a massive thanks to @DieselTech who has been leading a redesign of our wiki. Safe to say, at least 100 hours have been poured into re-organizing and updating a ton of the content from our old wiki into a brand new system. It looks slick and should be much easier to understand and search against. While we aren\u0027t yet ready to roll out, be on the look out next release for the full release. For those that want a sneak peak, you can check it out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki2.kavitareader.com\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOld Email Service\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, this release contains built-in email functionality. The old emailer will remain on for 1 week after this release to give time for people to update. If you are stuck on an old version, please reach out so we can help understand why and get you updated. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EKavita\u002B\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita\u002B is designed to work with the latest - 2 releases. If you are further than that out of date, it may no longer work appropriately. It is important to stay up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added limited parsing support for c01-c04. Normally, c01-04 is used. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Admins can now write custom cron notation for Scans, Backup, and Cleanup tasks. Cleanup cannot be disabled as it is required for Kavita to function smoothly. Ideal to always leave at midnight.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) New filter for Average Rating. This will allow you to filter on series that have an external average rating. Note: This only applies to series that have metadata pulled down from Kavita\u002B.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) Kavita will now store Kavita\u002B external ratings, reviews, and recommendations in your Database. This will increase performance and lays the foundation for the upcoming basic metadata from Kavita\u002B. Data is refreshed ad-hoc after 2 weeks and cached in memory for 48 hours. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) New button in Edit Series modal that allows the series to be invalidated (or removed from blocklist) and force refresh from Kavita\u002B on next series detail page view.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) User\u0027s can now see error messages and a different icon on Scrobbling History when a series fails to scrobble.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) Sort by Average Rating\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a new role that makes a user account read only. This means they cannot change anything themselves (Age Restriction, Email, Password, Forgot Password, API Key). This is not intended for users to use, but for the demo instance.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a popup that will tell users that are over 3 releases behind to update. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: New setting in Email settings to let you use Customized Template files. If this is true, Kavita will pick templates from config/templates rather than internal storage. Fallback is available.

    "BlogPart": "\u003Cp\u003EA small on the surface, large under the hood release for everyone. This release first off fixes the webtoon reader for our iOS users. Many have validated and want to thank the community for helping me test and @thundernerd for doing some basic POC to help me drive it home. In addition to this, Want to Read had a critical bug in the architecture (that somehow slipped noticed for over a year now) where if one user adds a series to want to read, then another does, it will override the other. And lastly, for Kavita\u002B users, this is foundational release for the upcoming Basic Metadata feature. All data, like reviews, recommendations, and ratings are now stored in your DB. This leads to very quick response times and sets up the system for future data synchronization. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother big feature in this release is KavitaEmail is no longer required for those that want to use email (and me hosting an email service for everyone is no more). All email settings are built into the application and this has allowed me to streamline how Kavita works around email. Before, it was a mess of having to call an external system, check if the system was accessible externally, etc. Now, you MUST setup a host name (reverse proxy domain) and the email settings to use any email functionality. Due to this, all the flows got polished and should be much more consistent for users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, while it looks so small, it was over 3K lines of code, but volume numbers are now float-based, meaning if a volume is \u0026lt; 1, it will now properly show on book library series detail page. In addition to this, Omnibus (Volume 1-2) is now much better supported and Kavita\u002B will get Volume 2 when you read an Omnibus vs Volume 1 previously.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat wraps the v0.7.x series of releases. Next release series (v0.8.x) will be focusing mainly on the new Magazine library type, PDF parsing enhancements, and likely the new comic library.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003ENew Wiki\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly I want to call out a massive thanks to @DieselTech who has been leading a redesign of our wiki. Safe to say, at least 100 hours have been poured into re-organizing and updating a ton of the content from our old wiki into a brand new system. It looks slick and should be much easier to understand and search against. While we aren\u0027t yet ready to roll out, be on the look out next release for the full release. For those that want a sneak peak, you can check it out \u003Ca href=\u0022https://wiki2.kavitareader.com\u0022\u003Ehere\u003C/a\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EOld Email Service\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs mentioned, this release contains built-in email functionality. The old emailer will remain on for 1 week after this release to give time for people to update. If you are stuck on an old version, please reach out so we can help understand why and get you updated. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EKavita\u002B\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKavita\u002B is designed to work with the latest - 2 releases. If you are further than that out of date, it may no longer work appropriately. It is important to stay up to date.\u003C/p\u003E\n"

I wanted to get this first release out quickly so I can share my plans as I\u0027m bursting with excitement. The release is pretty small and mainly focused on bugs I found during my holiday. With that out of the way, let\u0027s talk about Kavita this year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EProcess Change\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, I will be changing how feature requests are handled. Going forward, Kavita will solely use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/discussions/2529\u0022\u003EGithub Discussions\u003C/a\u003E for feature requests. Normal support will be done still via Issues and Discord and bugs of course via Issues. I tried many different things over the last 3 years. Given the scope of the application, I need something a bit more robust. The current feature site, while is nice, doesn\u0027t send alerts to users, leaving me without a means to communicate when I\u0027m actually ready to start a feature. Discord is just too chaotic and we lack visibility. All feature requests over 10 votes have been migrated over to Discussions already. Please go visit and engage so we can drive some of these home. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, let\u0027s talk about shaping features. Once a feature is on discussions and I agree, I will be taking this feature to my Kavita\u002B discord users to help shape the feature into the final solution. I usually rely on a few users for advice, but going forward, Kavita\u002B users (which many would consider power users) will have a strong say in shaping features going forward. Feedback is always welcome from non-Kavita\u002B users, but I want to utilize power users to drive features going forward. You can go to Kavita\u002B tab to link your Discord User Id with your Kavita\u002B license, which will grant you access to the hidden channels. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, the subreddit will be shutdown this year. I no longer use Reddit and unfortunately have to keep it as the subreddit needs questions answered. I hope you all can respect my decision and can migrate to discord for future discussions/support. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWebsite/Wiki\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is drastically out of date and quite bad. Originally I copied it from Lidarr, which I was one of the original developers, and meant to update it to a new look and feel, but never got around to it. This is finally the year to take action. A new design and stack has already been chosen and @therobbiedavis is taking lead on driving the effort. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the new website, I will be creating a blog. I need a centralized place to post updates that may not be tied to a release (like this post). The new website will host the blog and I will post releases there as well. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki is also in need of some love. It\u0027s quite difficult keeping it up to date myself. @DieselTech and @ThePromidius have helped a ton in that regard to updating, but we are in need of a deep redesign of the information and a new technology to allow better searching. We are investigating new software and are planning a complete revamp over this year. If anyone is knowledgeable about Kavita and wants to contribute, please reach out in discord. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe Features\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EKavita\u002B\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a few key features for Kavita\u002B that I want to test and if successful, deliver to you all. The first up is \u003Cstrong\u003EMetadata\u003C/strong\u003E. Komf is a great tool that already exists, but some users want something a bit simpler and that is where Kavita\u002B comes in. When I first started Kavita, I always had the goal of metadata integration but soon I learned how disjointed everything is and it seemed like adding it would become a full time job instead of letting me build out Kavita. As Kavita\u002B already has metadata from AniList, I see an opportunity to trial metadata integration. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of 2023, Robbie mentioned to me Hardcover, a potential integration point for Kavita\u002B that has similar features as AniList -- reviews, ratings, scrobblings, and metadata for books (and some limited comics). After speaking with their development team, this seems feasible to build out. I will be doing a deep dive later this year to bring these features into Kavita\u002B. This also means if metadata support is built out, it will benefit from Hardcover.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, as mentioned above, Kavita\u002B users will become critical to shaping and expanding on community ideas once accepted. Link your discord user id via Kavita and you will be granted access into the hidden channels to participate in defining the scope of an idea and provide feedback post implementation before it ships to stable users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EPDF\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPDF as many of you know has always been Kavita\u0027s weakest point. PDFs have no tools existing for metadata, have the worst and most inconsistent naming patterns out there and overall have just not been a good fit within Kavita. I want to change that this year. First off I want to polish the reader. I\u0027ve been using a reader that doesn\u0027t have many hooks nor does it have the ability to save the reading preferences. I had originally opened an issue for information on how people use Kavita, but the comments were underwhelming. I will be looking to my Kavita\u002B users to help shape this feature and deliver a good experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany users also collect magazines and I think it\u0027s high time a separate library type with different parsing is built out. Like I did with the image library last year, I will be adding a new library type explicitly for Magazines with a limited set of metadata and some UI differences. PDF parsing overall will be updated to be more robust and work better overall. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EComics\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComics are quite complicated and work differently than I had thought when users asked me many years to add comic support. This year I will be trialing a new library type that mimics ComicVine\u0027s format, which is the standard for Mylar and comics in general. As is the theme, my Kavita\u002B users, including @DieselTech  will be helping me drive the end solution. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EKobo Sync\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last major feature is Kobo sync. I bought a Kobo and am excited to reverse engineer the protocol to allow native sync with Kavita, much like calibre-web has. Originally this was planned as a Kavita\u002B feature, but after looking more into it, Kavita can service it without problem. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are more items on my list as well, but let\u0027s leave a bit to surprise. I\u0027m sure everyone can tell these are huge items with that will take tons of time. I\u0027m really excited for this year and what I can achieve. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ERemember to use the new \u003Ca href=\u0022https://hub.docker.com/r/jvmilazz0/kavita\u0022\u003EDocker Central Repo\u003C/a\u003E!\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) Added the ability to view the provider of a recommendation on the card itself and in the preview drawer.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) Added the ability to reset your Kavita\u002B license key without having to reach out to me.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) Added the ability to add your Discord UserId during Kavita\u002B license registration which will grant access to hidden channels for feature curtailing. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EChanged\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: When opening up an external series review, show the source of the review.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Streamlined the design slightly for a user\u0027s personal review\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: There is now inline form validation on the User Review Modal\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Removed the tagline from user/external reviews. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: (Scanner) When a series has a single special and a total count of 1 or less, assume it\u0027s completed\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Lots of love around the messaging when interacting with users that do not use real emails.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Enhanced the messaging around users without valid emails interacting with change email flow. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Validation messaging added on change username flow, including showing the valid characters.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Don\u0027t log apikey in logs\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Updated the donate link to point to a wiki explaining the donation options and that Kavita\u002B is the only way to remove the donate button.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EFixed\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fixed a bug where user reviews wouldn\u0027t be rendered on the UI if they didn\u0027t have a tagline, even though it\u0027s optional.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Ensure my own review orders in front of other local user reviews\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: When a user resets the API key, tell connected clients to refresh their account details\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Moved bulk operations bar back to the top of the page where it belongs on series detail\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: When using back on side nav after having a filter applied, clear the filter.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Cleaned up the error handling around Kavita\u002B registering of a license. \u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EFixed: Fix the issue of an extra space appearing after the end of the series detail page.

With that out of the way, let\u0027s talk about Kavita this year.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EProcess Change\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst off, I will be changing how feature requests are handled. Going forward, Kavita will solely use \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/discussions/2529\u0022\u003EGithub Discussions\u003C/a\u003E for feature requests. Normal support will be done still via Issues and Discord and bugs of course via Issues. I tried many different things over the last 3 years. Given the scope of the application, I need something a bit more robust. The current feature site, while is nice, doesn\u0027t send alerts to users, leaving me without a means to communicate when I\u0027m actually ready to start a feature. Discord is just too chaotic and we lack visibility. All feature requests over 10 votes have been migrated over to Discussions already. Please go visit and engage so we can drive some of these home. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext, let\u0027s talk about shaping features. Once a feature is on discussions and I agree, I will be taking this feature to my Kavita\u002B discord users to help shape the feature into the final solution. I usually rely on a few users for advice, but going forward, Kavita\u002B users (which many would consider power users) will have a strong say in shaping features going forward. Feedback is always welcome from non-Kavita\u002B users, but I want to utilize power users to drive features going forward. You can go to Kavita\u002B tab to link your Discord User Id with your Kavita\u002B license, which will grant you access to the hidden channels. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, the subreddit will be shutdown this year. I no longer use Reddit and unfortunately have to keep it as the subreddit needs questions answered. I hope you all can respect my decision and can migrate to discord for future discussions/support. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EWebsite/Wiki\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe website is drastically out of date and quite bad. Originally I copied it from Lidarr, which I was one of the original developers, and meant to update it to a new look and feel, but never got around to it. This is finally the year to take action. A new design and stack has already been chosen and @therobbiedavis is taking lead on driving the effort. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn addition to the new website, I will be creating a blog. I need a centralized place to post updates that may not be tied to a release (like this post). The new website will host the blog and I will post releases there as well. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe wiki is also in need of some love. It\u0027s quite difficult keeping it up to date myself. @DieselTech and @ThePromidius have helped a ton in that regard to updating, but we are in need of a deep redesign of the information and a new technology to allow better searching. We are investigating new software and are planning a complete revamp over this year. If anyone is knowledgeable about Kavita and wants to contribute, please reach out in discord. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch3\u003EThe Features\u003C/h3\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EKavita\u002B\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI have a few key features for Kavita\u002B that I want to test and if successful, deliver to you all. The first up is \u003Cstrong\u003EMetadata\u003C/strong\u003E. Komf is a great tool that already exists, but some users want something a bit simpler and that is where Kavita\u002B comes in. When I first started Kavita, I always had the goal of metadata integration but soon I learned how disjointed everything is and it seemed like adding it would become a full time job instead of letting me build out Kavita. As Kavita\u002B already has metadata from AniList, I see an opportunity to trial metadata integration. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the end of 2023, Robbie mentioned to me Hardcover, a potential integration point for Kavita\u002B that has similar features as AniList -- reviews, ratings, scrobblings, and metadata for books (and some limited comics). After speaking with their development team, this seems feasible to build out. I will be doing a deep dive later this year to bring these features into Kavita\u002B. This also means if metadata support is built out, it will benefit from Hardcover.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, as mentioned above, Kavita\u002B users will become critical to shaping and expanding on community ideas once accepted. Link your discord user id via Kavita and you will be granted access into the hidden channels to participate in defining the scope of an idea and provide feedback post implementation before it ships to stable users. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EPDF\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPDF as many of you know has always been Kavita\u0027s weakest point. PDFs have no tools existing for metadata, have the worst and most inconsistent naming patterns out there and overall have just not been a good fit within Kavita. I want to change that this year. First off I want to polish the reader. I\u0027ve been using a reader that doesn\u0027t have many hooks nor does it have the ability to save the reading preferences. I had originally opened an issue for information on how people use Kavita, but the comments were underwhelming. I will be looking to my Kavita\u002B users to help shape this feature and deliver a good experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMany users also collect magazines and I think it\u0027s high time a separate library type with different parsing is built out. Like I did with the image library last year, I will be adding a new library type explicitly for Magazines with a limited set of metadata and some UI differences. PDF parsing overall will be updated to be more robust and work better overall. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EComics\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EComics are quite complicated and work differently than I had thought when users asked me many years to add comic support. This year I will be trialing a new library type that mimics ComicVine\u0027s format, which is the standard for Mylar and comics in general. As is the theme, my Kavita\u002B users, including @DieselTech  will be helping me drive the end solution. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch4\u003EKobo Sync\u003C/h4\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe last major feature is Kobo sync. I bought a Kobo and am excited to reverse engineer the protocol to allow native sync with Kavita, much like calibre-web has. Originally this was planned as a Kavita\u002B feature, but after looking more into it, Kavita can service it without problem. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere are more items on my list as well, but let\u0027s leave a bit to surprise. I\u0027m sure everyone can tell these are huge items with that will take tons of time. I\u0027m really excited for this year and what I can achieve.\u003C/p\u003E\n"

Originally starting out after using Ubooquity and feeling limited by the lack of metadata and other solutions not aligning with my sense of UX, I started this project as a personal project to not only have a simple reader and organizer like Plex, but also learn .NET. Fast forward to now and Kavita has grown to be a name brand product and my vision has drastically expanded from a simple self project to becoming the Plex of the reading world. After 3 years of building this project solo (with some help from a few users here and there), I would think it would be nearly complete, yet I find myself with more work than ever as the ideas keep flowing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore we jump into this release, let\u0027s take a look back at some of the major features I\u0027ve released this year:\r\n- User and Server Stats (160 hours)\r\n- Double Page reader (100 hours)\r\n- CBL \u0026amp; Reading List Improvements (40 hours)\r\n- Vertical Reading support in Epub reader\r\n- Base URL Support\r\n- WebP and AVIF support \r\n- Kavita\u002B (and the review overhaul that went along with it) (600\u002B hours)\r\n- Dynamic covers for collections and reading lists (3 hours)\r\n- Personal Bookmarks in the Epub reader (12 hours)\r\n- Full app localization (80 hours)\r\n- A complete filtering overhaul with deep customization on how you filter (300 hours)\r\n- Smart Filters and customization of your side nav and Dashboard with those streams (300 hours)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis year has been huge in terms of delivering features to the users and also the transformation the underlying codebase has undergone to support these features. Overall, I\u0027ve delivered \u003Cstrong\u003E141 new features, 301 changes, and 277 fixes\u003C/strong\u003E. It has been a tremendous year indeed and much appreciation needs to go to @DieselTech and @scare376 who are basically the only nightly testers to test releases before it hits stable and provide a ton of support in the discord. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking forward to next year where I will finally get to work on some much needed features, like a complete PDF overhaul, kobo sync support, the start of the mobile app, and some really cool Kavita\u002B ideas that I\u0027ve been discussing in the discord (join if you want to give your opinion). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, this last release I had to take a step back and focus on the polish. There were a few performance issues and styling issues that were starting to nag me and after delivering such a huge update, I needed something a bit easier to relax with. This release is focused on polishing the application and I think this first pass brings a lot of nice smoothing to the edges in the app. I have more planned that I will sprinkle in next year. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst up is the .kavitaignore, which is a file you can place within any directory and apply glob syntax patterns which will exclude files and folders. While this is really powerful, it is an advanced feature that many don\u0027t use and requires updating your filesystem. I took a hard look, opened an issue and collected feedback from a few users and decided, let\u0027s bubble up this feature to the UI. .kavitaignore will be removed next year in the v0.8.x series of releases and instead, admins can now use the File Type switches and the Exclude Patterns in the Library Settings modal. I believe this will lead to higher adoption.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext is a minor feature that has huge feel--image loading. I overhauled the image loading code to be much smoother. Images fade in and the lazy loading is much more performant. You should immediately notice the difference. Along with this image loading, a lot of the readers got bugfixes and attention to close out some of the bugs that were reported. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/assets/735851/ca267333-82b1-4292-863a-a2565dfef029\u0022 alt=\u0022284079184-1468a1ad-66ab-48c6-a7dd-a9f8a6fbe696\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, let\u0027s talk about Smart Filters. As we all know, I had to do a few hotfixes due to some code around the smart filters and unfortunately, there were still more bugs in the system. This release should have all the bugs worked out. The testers and I really ensured it\u0027s working well. I wrote a migration to try and reduce data loss, but you might find some filters are broken. This is the cost of writing over 10K lines of new code around one feature and only 2 users helping with testing (\u003Cstrong\u003ESeriously, we \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E help, please join our nightly testing channel and help out\u003C/strong\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAside from the encoding issues, I realized that not all Smart filters need to be binded to the side nav or dashboard. I ended up building quite a few utility filters to identify series that have missing metadata, series that I started reading but forgot about, etc. With this release, in the user settings dropdown (top right of screen), you can now view all your Smart Filters and load them quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing I want to call out for those that read all the changes. I did a ton of polishing on the Publication Status code for a series to make it smarter than before. Books with just one book or series that are just a single special will mark as Completed. Kavita will fallback much better for Series that have a total Count in how it matches against Volumes or Chapters. These will need a force scan to pickup, but I think overall, leads to a much better experience. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: You can now see your total progress in the series from within the manga/image reader.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added a Smart Filters page so you can see all your filters and click to load them. The new page is accessed from your user settings (top right dropdown on nav). The smart filter will show red if the filter was not able to be migrated and needs to be recreated by you.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: New Library Type for Image. \u003Cstrong\u003EThis is a placeholder while I gather \u003Ca href=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/issues/2460\u0022\u003Efeedback\u003C/a\u003E to avoid a bug in non-image types.

If you have updated, copy one of your backups from config/backups for the day of the update and restore the DB.\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003E12/5 - Assets have been swapped\u003C/strong\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith this release, I\u0027ve hit 3 years of developing Kavita. Originally starting out after using Ubooquity and feeling limited by the lack of metadata and other solutions not aligning with my sense of UX, I started this project as a personal project to not only have a simple reader and organizer like Plex, but also learn .NET. Fast forward to now and Kavita has grown to be a name brand product and my vision has drastically expanded from a simple self project to becoming the Plex of the reading world. After 3 years of building this project solo (with some help from a few users here and there), I would think it would be nearly complete, yet I find myself with more work than ever as the ideas keep flowing. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBefore we jump into this release, let\u0027s take a look back at some of the major features I\u0027ve released this year:\r\n- User and Server Stats (160 hours)\r\n- Double Page reader (100 hours)\r\n- CBL \u0026amp; Reading List Improvements (40 hours)\r\n- Vertical Reading support in Epub reader\r\n- Base URL Support\r\n- WebP and AVIF support \r\n- Kavita\u002B (and the review overhaul that went along with it) (600\u002B hours)\r\n- Dynamic covers for collections and reading lists (3 hours)\r\n- Personal Bookmarks in the Epub reader (12 hours)\r\n- Full app localization (80 hours)\r\n- A complete filtering overhaul with deep customization on how you filter (300 hours)\r\n- Smart Filters and customization of your side nav and Dashboard with those streams (300 hours)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis year has been huge in terms of delivering features to the users and also the transformation the underlying codebase has undergone to support these features. Overall, I\u0027ve delivered \u003Cstrong\u003E141 new features, 301 changes, and 277 fixes\u003C/strong\u003E. It has been a tremendous year indeed and much appreciation needs to go to @DieselTech and @scare376 who are basically the only nightly testers to test releases before it hits stable and provide a ton of support in the discord. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI\u0027m looking forward to next year where I will finally get to work on some much needed features, like a complete PDF overhaul, kobo sync support, the start of the mobile app, and some really cool Kavita\u002B ideas that I\u0027ve been discussing in the discord (join if you want to give your opinion). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith that said, this last release I had to take a step back and focus on the polish. There were a few performance issues and styling issues that were starting to nag me and after delivering such a huge update, I needed something a bit easier to relax with. This release is focused on polishing the application and I think this first pass brings a lot of nice smoothing to the edges in the app. I have more planned that I will sprinkle in next year. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFirst up is the .kavitaignore, which is a file you can place within any directory and apply glob syntax patterns which will exclude files and folders. While this is really powerful, it is an advanced feature that many don\u0027t use and requires updating your filesystem. I took a hard look, opened an issue and collected feedback from a few users and decided, let\u0027s bubble up this feature to the UI. .kavitaignore will be removed next year in the v0.8.x series of releases and instead, admins can now use the File Type switches and the Exclude Patterns in the Library Settings modal. I believe this will lead to higher adoption.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENext is a minor feature that has huge feel--image loading. I overhauled the image loading code to be much smoother. Images fade in and the lazy loading is much more performant. You should immediately notice the difference. Along with this image loading, a lot of the readers got bugfixes and attention to close out some of the bugs that were reported. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/assets/735851/ca267333-82b1-4292-863a-a2565dfef029\u0022 alt=\u0022284079184-1468a1ad-66ab-48c6-a7dd-a9f8a6fbe696\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, let\u0027s talk about Smart Filters. As we all know, I had to do a few hotfixes due to some code around the smart filters and unfortunately, there were still more bugs in the system. This release should have all the bugs worked out. The testers and I really ensured it\u0027s working well. I wrote a migration to try and reduce data loss, but you might find some filters are broken. This is the cost of writing over 10K lines of new code around one feature and only 2 users helping with testing (\u003Cstrong\u003ESeriously, we \u003Cem\u003Eneed\u003C/em\u003E help, please join our nightly testing channel and help out\u003C/strong\u003E). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAside from the encoding issues, I realized that not all Smart filters need to be binded to the side nav or dashboard. I ended up building quite a few utility filters to identify series that have missing metadata, series that I started reading but forgot about, etc. With this release, in the user settings dropdown (top right of screen), you can now view all your Smart Filters and load them quickly. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOne last thing I want to call out for those that read all the changes. I did a ton of polishing on the Publication Status code for a series to make it smarter than before. Books with just one book or series that are just a single special will mark as Completed. Kavita will fallback much better for Series that have a total Count in how it matches against Volumes or Chapters. These will need a force scan to pickup, but I think overall, leads to a much better experience.\u003C/p\u003E\n"

    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003Ev0.7.9 is here and brings along with it major changes in the customization that Kavita provides it\u0027s users out of the box. This has been something I\u0027ve been wanting to work on for over a year now, but as with all things, finding time and balancing new features and their order doesn\u0027t always go as planned. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release brings 3 major customization features: Dashboard, Side Nav, and External Sources plus Series Preview for Kavita\u002B users. These features are for all users, not just admins. Let\u0027s dive in.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EDashboard\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHave you ever wanted On Deck to work differently? Do you not need Newly Added series on your dashboard or perhaps want a filtered list of series easily available? This feature is for you. As of this release, you can first build a custom filter and save it as a Smart Filter. This is a live filter that can be modified at any time and will reflect everywhere it\u0027s binded. From the Home Side Nav item, click the actionable dots and then Customize. You can now turn the visibility on/off of Kavita provided Streams, add your own smart filters to your Dashboard and even reorder everything. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ESide Nav\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENot only do we have a customized dashboard, but the side nav got some love as well. If you\u0027re a large comic collector, you\u0027ll know that the best practice is to split your series into libraries by Publisher (to avoid collision on the same series name released in different years). This can be frustrating as that leaves you with over 200 different libraries and adds so much clutter on your screen. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new feature changes that. First, only 10 items will ever render by default with a More button to show more items under the fold, taking inspiration from YouTube and Plex. Then, like with Dashboard customization, you can reorder, bind smart filters, or turn on/off the visibility of some libraries. Bulk selection tools are available to help those users with many libraries. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/assets/735851/7c4c7ff0-7a85-4186-a0b2-e34ab8a73904\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003EExternal Sources\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EExternal sources plays on the Side Nav customization by allowing you to setup a link on your side nav that upon being clicked will open your friend\u0027s server up already authenticated as you. This is just the start, after rolling this out to our nightly users discussion sparked and in the future I will be adding the ability to allow searching media in your friend\u0027s server directly from your own instance (Kavita\u002B only). \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch2\u003ESeries Preview (Kavita\u002B)\u003C/h2\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor those that have Kavita\u002B, they are likely very familiar with the Recommendations tab. When looking at recommendations, you will see your own Series that you own and external ones (if you are an admin). The problem is, it\u0027s a bit annoying clicking on each external series, switching tabs, reading about it, then coming back to Kavita. So I fixed that. Now, a drawer will open and bring that metadata to you, making it quick for you to read about the series right from within Kavita. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/assets/735851/4fdbd562-bbf5-4fdf-9bdb-28b4436e1660\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis release has been pretty large in terms of the features and refactoring that had to be done to bring these features to you all. Just the side nav rework took 6k lines of code to do :/ I\u0027m extremely pleased with how my vision came to fruition and look forward to seeing the customizations you all create. The next release should be the last of the v0.7.x series of releases and is the last foundational piece that has to happen before I can do any work on the mobile app. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EImportant Announcements\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EWith Smart Filters released, I want to see what creations you can come up with.

    "UpdateBody": "\u003Cp\u003EAnother major feature has been reworked as I lay down those foundational changes you may hear me talk about. Kavita now has a brand new filtering system to enable users to really poke and prod their media. This was a huge undertaking ensuring a flexible system could be built and allow new features to be added upon it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/assets/735851/fedb9b6a-bf6c-4e6e-a8db-329c8ae8c065\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new filtering allows for you to not only reproduce what was already there, but expand and AND your statements together. I originally sought out building a recursive system, but unfortunately I kept hitting difficulties in coding the UI, that I decided to simplify. I can always enhance later if needed. You will noticed many different combinations and new fields. I\u0027ve added quite a few new fields, but if you have creative ideas, please do raise a feature request for them. I\u0027m interested in expanding the filters even further to allow you to craft some unique filters. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this update, I also spruced up the OPDS implementations thanks to some nice feature hub requests that got me thinking. I personally don\u0027t use OPDS, but I think for those that do, you\u0027ll notice it\u0027s a much better experience. No more formats at the end of the series names (as we put that in the description) and series descriptions are actually sending (they have been hooked up, but weren\u0027t being set, oops). While I was fixing those, I added new feeds for want to read, to make the experience the best it can be. If you\u0027ve heard about the OPDS2 work, Kavita will be adding it as well. I\u0027ve been involved in the discussions with Readium about the spec along with Komga, Codex, and Panels. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, localization has seen major progress. The community has really stepped up and as of me writing these release notes, Kavita is fully translated to Korean, Chinese (Simplified), and basically Italian (1 word...). Many other languages have over 80% strings translated. I\u0027ve also fixed a ton of missed strings throughout the app. Thank you so much to those that have added their own languages. It\u0027s really cool seeing the application translated. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat wraps the big features. As I\u0027ve been mentioning many times in these release notes, my focus for the v0.7.x releases are major foundational changes that I need so I can start the mobile apps for Kavita. I\u0027ve unfortunately been struck by the Return to Office plague and due to this, have much less time to work on Kavita, so updates may slow (plus I have yet another holiday this month).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: From Reading list, you can now click on a character tag and open a pre-filtered search screen.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: OPDS feeds now include a new section for Want to Read series\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Admins now have the ability to change the cover image size. The options are: Default (320x455), Medium (640x909), Large (900x1277), Extra Large (1265x1795) (Thanks @Ark1369)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: User day breakdown stat graph is now visible on a user stats page\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added an id for komf userscript to help it inject into Kavita\u0027s UI without relying on strings, given localization.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: You can now filter by Path, which is the highest folder for a Series.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: You can now filter by filepath, which is the full path of a file, including extension. This is much slower than Path, but still useable.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: You can now filter by Series Summary (to help you find series with missing metadata)\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: New filter comparison called Must Contains which does just that, ensures that the values provided are in every series.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: Added ability to delete single collections from card actions.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003C/ul\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EChanged\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Revamped how metadata filtering works to allow custom combinations, searching for information on nested properties, etc.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: OPDS Series names will no longer show (Format) in the series name. It will be displayed in the summary field instead along with the summary if one is set.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: If the language tag isn\u0027t properly set, then series detail wont show it anymore.\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: Changed the HTTP Cache for all-languages API\u003C/li\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EChanged: API key and OPDS url are now hidden by default.

    "BlogPart": "\u003Cp\u003EAnother major feature has been reworked as I lay down those foundational changes you may hear me talk about. Kavita now has a brand new filtering system to enable users to really poke and prod their media. This was a huge undertaking ensuring a flexible system could be built and allow new features to be added upon it. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/assets/735851/fedb9b6a-bf6c-4e6e-a8db-329c8ae8c065\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis new filtering allows for you to not only reproduce what was already there, but expand and AND your statements together. I originally sought out building a recursive system, but unfortunately I kept hitting difficulties in coding the UI, that I decided to simplify. I can always enhance later if needed. You will noticed many different combinations and new fields. I\u0027ve added quite a few new fields, but if you have creative ideas, please do raise a feature request for them. I\u0027m interested in expanding the filters even further to allow you to craft some unique filters. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn this update, I also spruced up the OPDS implementations thanks to some nice feature hub requests that got me thinking. I personally don\u0027t use OPDS, but I think for those that do, you\u0027ll notice it\u0027s a much better experience. No more formats at the end of the series names (as we put that in the description) and series descriptions are actually sending (they have been hooked up, but weren\u0027t being set, oops). While I was fixing those, I added new feeds for want to read, to make the experience the best it can be. If you\u0027ve heard about the OPDS2 work, Kavita will be adding it as well. I\u0027ve been involved in the discussions with Readium about the spec along with Komga, Codex, and Panels. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELastly, localization has seen major progress. The community has really stepped up and as of me writing these release notes, Kavita is fully translated to Korean, Chinese (Simplified), and basically Italian (1 word...). Many other languages have over 80% strings translated. I\u0027ve also fixed a ton of missed strings throughout the app. Thank you so much to those that have added their own languages. It\u0027s really cool seeing the application translated. \u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat wraps the big features. As I\u0027ve been mentioning many times in these release notes, my focus for the v0.7.x releases are major foundational changes that I need so I can start the mobile apps for Kavita. I\u0027ve unfortunately been struck by the Return to Office plague and due to this, have much less time to work on Kavita, so updates may slow (plus I have yet another holiday this month).\u003C/p\u003E\n"

This release we see the addition of two cool features: Remove from On Deck and Overall Ratings. Overall ratings is a new feature that allows any series within your Kavita instance to show the average rating from other users (in addition to you own). A nice feature that drives more intra-server communication, something I\u0027m looking to explore more in the future.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg src=\u0022https://github.com/Kareadita/Kavita/assets/735851/24cb8e58-dbea-44d5-80d8-8b035f0f05d7\u0022 alt=\u0022image\u0022 /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe big feature is Remove from On Deck. On deck are series that have recently had a new chapter within 7 days or reading activity within 3 weeks. These numbers are now customizable, but what if you have a series you just started reading but didn\u0027t vibe with. It would be annoying seeing it every day on your On Deck. You could previously mark as unread or just wait (or read a bunch of stuff to move it further down the list). Now, you can just remove it. Once removed, it wont be shown until you create any reading progress on it. You can remove it as many times as you need.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Ch1\u003EAdded\u003C/h1\u003E\n\u003Cul\u003E\n\u003Cli\u003EAdded: (Kavita\u002B) Added favorite count on AL and MAL ratings.
